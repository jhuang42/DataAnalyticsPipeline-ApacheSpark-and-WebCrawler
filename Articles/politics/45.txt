Additional hawkish changes—a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer-run funds rate estimates—are also possible but not our base case.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="618" data-total-count="2091"><strong>Michelle Meyer</strong>, <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch</em>: Ms. Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting, but “unlike December where there were two dissents, we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction. The focus will be on the evolution of the dots: we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year, but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019. We also think the long-run dot will edge up to 2.875%. This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes, but without an urgency to front-load the tightening.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="839" data-total-count="2930"><strong>Ian Shepherdson</strong>, <em>Pantheon Macroeconomics</em>: Mr. Powell “is bound to be faced with questions along the lines of “Why are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial, unfunded fiscal easing?”. His reply, we suspect, will be something like: “It’s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy, and it’s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases. Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent, and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up, so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation. In any event, with inflation well below target, gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="426" data-total-count="3356"><strong>Stephen Stanley,</strong> <em>Amherst Pierpont:</em> “The bulk of the interest in this week’s F.O.M.C. meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F.O.M.C. statement. Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction, though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="3703"><strong>Steve Rick, </strong><em>CUNA Mutual Group:</em> There is “a very strong case for not only raising rates this week, but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017. I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three, with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="403" data-total-count="4106"><strong>Chris </strong><strong>Zaccarelli</strong><strong>,</strong> <em>Independent Advisor Alliance</em>: “Whether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn’t be that big of a difference to the economy, but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology. Every statement – whether spoken or written – will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1% higher (or only 75 bps) a year from now.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="4383">President Trump’s plan to hit countries around the world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/trump-tariffs.html">stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum</a> has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="4588" id="story-continues-4">On Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="4729">In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced “relatively quickly.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="4746">Mr. Mnuchin said:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="438" data-total-count="5357">Mr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions.
