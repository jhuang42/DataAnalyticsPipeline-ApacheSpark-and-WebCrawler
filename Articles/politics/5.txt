Diminishing vitality in the marketplace has become a mounting concern among economists and policy makers.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="83" data-total-count="3570">One advantage of Furman’s approach is that it cuts across ideological boundaries.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="546" data-total-count="4116">In a speech in Chicago last month, “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160916_searle_conference_competition_furman_cea.pdf">Beyond Antitrust: The Role of Competition Policy in Promoting Inclusive Growth</a>,” Furman made the case that there has been a dangerous reduction in competition in the United States because of growing corporate concentration, barriers to entry facing new firms, restrictions on worker mobility, excessive legislative protection of patents and intellectual property, and developments in technology that give huge market power over potential challengers to such <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27916/facebook-platform">internet platforms</a> as Facebook, eBay and PayPal.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="4536">To support his case, Furman cites a wide range of data and reports. These include the finding that “in 42 percent of the roughly 900 industries examined, the top four firms controlled more than a third of the market in 2012, up from 28 percent of industries in 1997” and that in financial services, “the loan market share of the top ten banks increased from about 30 percent in 1980 to about 50 percent in 2010.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="457" data-total-count="4993">If the creation of new firms is a marker of a thriving competitive economy, Furman argues that the trends are not favorable. The accompanying chart shows a sharp decline over the past 30-plus years in the percentage of companies that are five years old or less, from just over 50 percent in 1982 to roughly 33 percent now, and a decline in the share of total employment provided by these young firms, from roughly 21 percent in 1982 to about 11 percent now.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="5187">The decline in corporate dynamism has been accompanied by a decline in labor dynamism, with “workers less likely to move between jobs, industries, occupations, and locations,” Furman writes.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="5404" id="story-continues-4">What Furman describes is a nation suffering from what amounts to economic arteriosclerosis.

Furman describes the trend as follows:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="6746">Despite rising returns to capital, there has not been a parallel increase in business investment. “One explanation,” Furman argues, “is that monopoly power has increased — which is consistent with higher returns and lower output.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="6987">Together, “declining firm dynamism, high returns and low output, and disparities in the rate of return on investment are all potential consequences of increasing barriers to entry” and restraining the operation of a free and open market.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="97" data-total-count="7084">With these findings in place, Furman has laid out the groundwork for a liberal Democratic agenda:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="7510">Furman describes four areas where pro-competitive reforms are possible — and in some cases have already been initiated.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="7785">The first is intellectual property and patent reform, areas where there is growing bipartisan agreement that excessive and often frivolous patent claims and the emergence of a new breed of patent tort litigators have held back innovation, especially technological innovation.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="8103">The second is the need to increase the bargaining power of workers, whose leverage has steadily declined.

On one hand, internet markets “have tended to favor digital giants that hold high market shares” and digitalization also poses an increased danger of opaque price fixing through the “use of advanced machine learning algorithms to set prices and adapt product functionality.” On the other hand, the digital marketplace has encouraged competition by lowering “many costs for small businesses, increasing their ability to rapidly and inexpensively scale up, collect information on potential consumers, and create new products and ideas.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="66" data-total-count="10411">There is disagreement among economists concerning Furman’s work.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="10620">Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, wrote me by email: “I am a big fan of Jason Furman and think the directions he has been sketching on technology, competition, and globalization make a lot of sense.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="10924">David Card, an economist at Berkeley, conversely, wrote that he does not think Furman’s proposals “will amount to more than a couple of percentage points higher wages (or a few percent lower prices) for low to middle income folks.” Overall, Card said, “I am deeply skeptical, to say the least.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="119" data-total-count="11043" id="story-continues-6">I would argue that even if Card is right, wages that are a couple of percentage points higher are nothing to sneeze at.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="11254">Furman’s proposals should not be viewed in isolation, but as one piece of a broader liberal agenda — an agenda that could include some or all of what Larry Summers, Isabel Sawhill, and others, have proposed.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="11396">Hillary Clinton has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/upshot/liberal-economists-think-big-companies-are-too-powerful-hillary-clinton-agrees.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAntitrust%20Laws%20and%20Competition%20Issues&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection">already declared</a> in campaign speeches that she intends to promote the kinds of reforms Furman and Summers are calling for.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="11595">President Obama has presided over a credible recovery from the 2008 crisis and he has amassed a number of achievements, including, according to <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/obamas-numbers-october-2016-update/">an ongoing compilation</a> by Factcheck.org, the following:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="12483">There have also been a number of failures, as Factcheck.org also pointed out, perhaps most notably a 36 percent rise in the number of Americans on food stamps and a 0.3 increase in the poverty rate.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="12703">Assuming for the moment that Clinton is Obama’s successor, it will fall to her to build on his record and to address the yearning of those hard-pressed voters who have felt for far too long like beggars at the banquet.</p>]
