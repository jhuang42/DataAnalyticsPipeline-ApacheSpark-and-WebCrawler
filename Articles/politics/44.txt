Mueller III, the special counsel, in his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, President Trump’s former campaign manager Paul J. Manafort Jr. and his business partner, Rick Gates, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html">have been indicted</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="523">Separately, George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/george-papadopoulos-russia.html">has pleaded guilty</a> to lying to federal investigators about meetings in March and April 2016 with a Russian agent who promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="861">The charges against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates center on a series of criminal allegations related to their lobbying for a pro-Russia government of Ukraine, not to Mr. Trump or the campaign. It is widely believed that Mr. Mueller is hoping to pressure Mr. Manafort into providing information about the central subject of his investigation.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="1022"><em>Below are excerpts from the indictment followed by analysis by New York Times reporters. We will continue to update as our team goes through the legal documents.</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="442" data-total-count="2341">The opening paragraph of the indictment lays out a narrative framework for understanding the complex details subsequent pages delve into. In brief, prosecutors contend that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates violated a law that requires Americans to register and disclose activities undertaken as agents of a foreign power, and then that they took steps to launder tens of millions of dollars in income from that work and to evade paying taxes on it.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="3757" id="story-continues-1">In July, Mr. Mueller’s team and the F.B.I. executed an unusual search warrant at Mr. Manafort’s home in Virginia in which, rather than knocking on his front door, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/mueller-russia-investigation.html">picked the lock and burst inside</a>, seizing documents and copying computer files. Such an unannounced intrusion is permitted only when prosecutors convince a judge that a defendant may destroy evidence if given any warning.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="4092" id="story-continues-3">The indictment suggests what was behind the raid. After questions arose about whether Mr. Manafort had failed to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine, his firm denied the allegations but also told federal investigators in November 2016 that they had no records about the work because their policy is to destroy emails after 30 days.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="4353">This line in the indictment shows what prosecutors found in that raid: documents related to his lobbying for Ukraine that Mr. Manafort’s lobbying company had told federal investigators did not exist — one of the bases for charges of making false statements.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="5681">Americans who hold assets in offshore bank accounts are required to disclose information about those holdings to the federal government, including for tax purposes. The indictment alleges that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates violated those laws.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="468" data-total-count="6551">The indictment shows how the investigators’ deep scrutiny of Mr. Manafort’s financial dealings helped them uncover additional alleged offenses that resulted in charges. For example, Mr. Manafort “used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income,” according to the indictment, by having his overseas entities buy real estate and then taking out mortgages on those properties, freeing up cash.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="6798">The indictment details several such transactions in which Mr. Manafort is accused of falsely telling the bank he was either living in the properties or was using the borrowed funds for construction, thereby gaining access to a lower interest rate.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="424" data-total-count="7858">The first charge against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates is conspiracy, a powerful tool used by prosecutors. Two people are guilty of the crime of conspiracy if they agreed to commit a crime and took any step toward that goal. Conspiracy charges also permit prosecutors to hold each defendant responsible for the actions of the others within a plot. Here is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/collusion-trump-russia-campaign.html">primer on how conspiracy charges</a> may fit into the Trump-Russia probe.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="500" data-total-count="9644">Money laundering charges require that the financial transactions involved be designed to conceal that funds came from an underlying unlawful activity. Typically, such charges are pegged to a crime like drug trafficking. Here, prosecutors say, the underlying activity is instead the failure by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to register as a foreign agent while conducting lobbying activities for Ukraine that were otherwise lawful in and of themselves. That is an aggressive move by Mr. Mueller’s team.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="477" data-total-count="10539" id="story-continues-4">As part of the pressure Mr. Mueller and his team are putting on Mr. Manafort, they are signaling in this indictment that if he is convicted of various charges, the government will seek to seize various properties and a life insurance policy linked to those charges — or any other assets he may have, if those are no longer available. This gives Mr. Manafort an additional incentive to cooperate as part of a plea deal that could allow his family to keep some of those assets.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="579" data-total-count="11145">Mr. Mueller’s personal signature appears at the end of this indictment, a rare direct acknowledgment of his work. Little has been heard in public from Mr. Mueller since he took the assignment of special counsel, even as political commentary about him and his work has raged — especially from President Trump, who has called the special counsel investigation a “witch hunt” and on Monday reiterated on Twitter that there was “no collusion” with Russia and said of the indictment, “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="11514">The indictment, though undoubtedly significant, also raises the question of what Mr. Mueller’s next step will be. But it is widely believed that Mr. Mueller is hoping to pressure Mr. Manafort into flipping and becoming a cooperating witness, providing information about the central subject of his investigation: the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>]
