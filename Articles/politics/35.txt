The N.S.A. spying program authorized under the law has drawn criticism both from civil libertarians and, more recently, from supporters of Mr. Trump who have expressed alarm about leaks of surveillance about Trump associates’ contacts with Russians. In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/opinion/congress-reauthorize-foreign-surveillance.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0">Op-Ed article published in The Times on Wednesday</a>, President Trump’s Homeland Security adviser, Thomas P.

Mr. McCabe said he could not discuss anything “within the purview” of the Justice Department investigation being run by Robert S. Mueller III, who was appointed special counsel last month.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="243" data-total-count="6270">“Why does the special counsel get preference and not this committee?” Mr. King said, revealing senators’ intensifying concerns over the conflicting needs of the separate congressional and federal investigations into Russian interference.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="6477">Mr. King then turned his attention to Mr. Coats and Mr. Rogers, who refused answer in detail questions about reports that Mr. Trump had asked them to publicly or privately undermine the F.B.I. investigation.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="6825" id="story-continues-7">Mr. Rogers said he had asked the White House whether it was invoking executive privilege to keep him from discussing possible related conversations with Mr. Trump, but had not gotten a response. Presidents have in the past cited the privilege to try to prevent Congress from seeking information about internal conversations in the executive branch.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="117" data-total-count="6942">Mr. Coats struggled to respond when Mr. King turned to him, the senator’s frustrations with the witnesses apparent.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="7078">“You swore that oath to tell us the truth,” Mr. King said, demanding the “legal basis” for Mr. Coats’ decision not to comment.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="7214">“I’m not sure I have a legal basis,” Mr. Coats said, adding that he would be happy to discuss it further in a closed-door session.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="441" data-total-count="7699">In an important development in the surveillance debate, the national intelligence director indicated that the Trump administration would not attempt to quantify the volume of Americans’ communications that are incidentally collected without a warrant under the FISA Amendments Act. That law permits the government to collect, without a warrant, communications of foreigners abroad — even when they are talking with or emailing Americans.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="611" data-total-count="8310">For several years, dating back to the Obama administration, members of Congress have been asking the government to provide an estimate of how often that program incidentally collects Americans’ communications with people abroad. The answer matters because current rules permit analysts — including F.B.I. agents who are working on ordinary criminal cases — to query the repository of messages collected that way by searching for Americans’ names or identifiers, such as their email addresses. Critics have proposed requiring a warrant to perform such a query, which critics call “backdoor searches.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="476" data-total-count="8786">Mr. Coats said that he had studied the issue and that coming up with an estimate would be difficult. Among other problems, he said, it would require doing intensive investigations of who is using certain email accounts where the nationality of the person is not obvious. That would invade the privacy of people who are not targets of investigations, he said, and divert resources better spent working on counterterrorism and other types of foreign intelligence investigations.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="8984">“Even if we decided the privacy intrusions were justified and if I had unlimited staff to tackle the problem, we still do not believe it is possible to come up with an accurate result,” he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="9188" id="story-continues-8">Mr. Coats cited two examples of counterterrorism investigations where the FISA Amendments Act warrantless surveillance program had been useful.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="298" data-total-count="9486">One was a case the government has been citing for years: the discovery in 2009 that an Afghan-American man in Colorado, Najibullah Zazi, was preparing a bombing attack on the New York City subway system. It was found by officials’ targeting an email account used by a Pakistan-based Qaeda member.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="9745">But Mr. Coats also brought up another example, which he said was a “sensitive” disclosure. In March 2016, an American Special Operations raid in Syria killed an Islamic State commander, Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, who also went by the name Haji Imam.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="10056">Mr. Coats said the intelligence that led to that operation, including information about Mr. Qaduli’s location, relied heavily on information gathered by FISA Amendments Act surveillance of one of his associates. After the operation, surveillance under that law also confirmed that he had been killed, he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="10347">After Admiral Rogers walked the committee through the procedure for revealing the identities of Americans in intelligence reports derived from N.S.A. surveillance, Mr. Coats said he had commissioned a review of whether those steps are appropriate.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="399" data-total-count="10746">The procedures require the N.S.A. to cover up American identities. A report might say, for example, that someone in the Russian government who’s under surveillance discussed a conversation with or about “U.S. Person 1,” rather than naming that person. But the rules permit a recipient of the report to request the identity of the American if it is necessary to understand foreign intelligence.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="601" data-total-count="11347">Such so-called unmaskings have become a political issue because supporters of the Trump administration, including Representative Nunes, the House intelligence chairman, have accused Obama administration officials of improperly requesting the unmasking of Trump campaign associates. The dispute is part of a tug-of-war about the flood of attention on Russian interference in the election and the F.B.I. investigation into possible coordination by Trump associates. Trump supporters say public scrutiny should be diverted instead to leaks about what Obama-era surveillance showed about those activities.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="11656">Admiral Rogers said that a request has to “tangibly apply” to the requester’s job responsibilities and must be made in writing, and that only 20 people at the N.S.A. have the authority to approve it. If so, only the requester receives the information, not everyone who read the original report, he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="202" data-total-count="11858" id="story-continues-9">Mr. Coats then said he wanted “our civil liberties and privacy protection agencies to take a look at this,” including whether those were the right procedures or something should be done differently.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="12194">It was not clear to whom he was referring. The most obvious body to do a review and make any recommendations, the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, is dormant because four of its five board positions are vacant and it lacks a quorum to begin new projects. Mr. Trump has not nominated anyone to fill its vacancies.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="12498">Democrats immediately made clear on Wednesday that they intended to use the surveillance hearing to press the assembled witnesses about the Russia investigation and the Trump administration’s reported attempts to interfere with it.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="513" data-total-count="13011">In his opening statement, the ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, reminded the witnesses that the intelligence community is supposed to tell it straight and ignore partisan political considerations. He then brought up Mr. Trump’s having said he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Mr. Comey, as well as reports that the president pressed intelligence agency leaders to publicly play down the investigation and to privately push Mr. Comey to pull back on it.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="13378">“If any of this is true, it would be an appalling and improper use of our intelligence professionals — an act that could erode the public’s confidence in our intelligence institutions,” he said. He added, “Any attempt by the White House or even the president himself to exploit this community as a tool for political purposes is deeply, deeply troubling.”</p>]
