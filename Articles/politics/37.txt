(The selfies are free.)</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="1104" id="story-continues-2">The hotel — a melting pot for Trump family members, Trump surrogates, tourists, YouTube celebrities, journalists and the occasional white nationalist — has earned that status in no small part because it is home to the only Washington restaurant that President Trump visits.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="406" data-total-count="1510" id="story-continues-4">His company also earns a cut — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/politics/trumps-financial-disclosures.html?_r=0">about $20 million over 15 months</a>, according to financial disclosure forms — which has outraged ethics experts and led to various lawsuits, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/trump-foreign-payments-constitution-lawsuit.html">including one filed in January against the Trump administration</a> by a group of lawyers. They accused the president of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="1733">“It’s the same old cesspool,” said Richard W. Painter, one of the lawyers in the group and an ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House. “It’s just that now the president is getting a cut of the revenue.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="1928">But for those who are happy to spend money here, the hotel, dripping in crystals, slicked with marble and upholstered in blue velvet, feels a bit like a “Make America Great Again” theme park.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="2195" id="story-continues-6">Several visits in August by reporters for The New York Times confirmed that some of the swamp’s most prominent Republicans come out at night and gather in the lobby of the 263-room hotel, conveniently located on Pennsylvania Avenue five blocks from the White House.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="2272">Where to look first? Opulence overwhelms the senses, making it hard to focus.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="2616">There is a giant American flag hanging among chandeliers. Four large TV screens over the bar offer sports, stocks, more sports and Fox News. And frequent trills of a bell indicate that someone has opened a bottle of champagne with a saber — <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4129072/Steve-Mnuchin-champagne-opened-saber-Trump-hotel.html">an activity</a> recently enjoyed by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. He used to live in the hotel.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="2876">Up one marble staircase is BLT Prime by David Burke, a lamplit steakhouse overlooking the lobby. For the cost of a $60 cut of beef — not including appetizers, sides or drinks — any visitor can eat like the president, who most <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffmiamicpa/status/891646272209383424">recently visited in late July</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="509" data-total-count="3385">Waiters say the commander in chief prefers a well-done Kansas City-cut steak, a Bible-thick slab of meat that is wheeled over on a large trolley stocked with tiny cups of ketchup. Visitors can wash it down with a $16 Manhattan Tea Party cocktail or — if the waiter is successful with his upcharge pitch — a $150 glass of Louis XIII cognac. A $22 cheesecake lollipop tree comes with a dollop of bubble gum whipped cream that feels more like putty and tastes not unlike dental fluoride. It is a best-seller.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="3539">Not everyone goes for the red meat. During a brief period last month when Anthony Scaramucci was the hotel’s most notorious resident, he preferred fish.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="3763" id="story-continues-7">Mr. Scaramucci, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/us/politics/trump-white-house-obamacare-health.html">dispatched as the White House communications director</a> on July 31 after serving a bombastic, profanity-laced 10 days in the job, made a beeline for BLT Prime, and the salmon, on the night he was fired.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="3984">“Anthony is here,” a solemn-faced hotel employee said that evening, requesting anonymity out of fear that he, too, might be fired for speaking indiscreetly. “He’s angry. He’s sad. He’s staying at the hotel.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="343" data-total-count="4327">Mr. Scaramucci’s last supper was well documented: Katrina Pierson, a former Trump campaign spokeswoman and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWy6iiRjFW7/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=katrinapierson">a constant fixture</a> in the hotel, dined with him. She took a picture of salmon. Then she took a selfie with Mr. Scaramucci. Then she posted both images to her Snapchat account. As they ate, news of the meal hit Twitter’s bloodstream.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="4680">In happier times — was that only a month ago? — Mr. Scaramucci gamely posed for photographs in the lobby, including one taken by Kathy McDonald, a political strategist. “3 Italian stallions,” Ms. McDonald wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BW9OzjdAArH/?taken-at=1024936088">an Instagram post</a> of Mr. Scaramucci, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Antonio Sabato Jr., an actor and Trump supporter running for Congress.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="4819">“There are no protesters,” Ms. McDonald said of her visit. “It’s a very safe environment. The guard at the door was pretty buff.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="4988">There are plenty of other dimly lit restaurants in Washington that offer high-profile political sightings, but none are nearly as friendly to smartphone-waving tourists.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="472" data-total-count="5460">At Georgetown’s Cafe Milano, an Italian restaurant known for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/style/cafe-milano-donald-trump-washington.html">protecting the privacy of its patrons</a>, it is not uncommon to spot a cabinet secretary. At Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House in City Center, White House aides, including Kellyanne Conway, are known to drop by. Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, often dines out at Le Diplomate, the French restaurant he visited after the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html">withdrew from the Paris climate accord</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="5537" id="story-continues-8">But only one place offers the promise of spotting a Trump in the gilded wild.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="407" data-total-count="5944" id="story-continues-10">For two evenings during the first week in August, that was Eric Trump, the main attraction in the lobby and one of two Trump sons overseeing the president’s real estate empire. Seated at a table facing the lobby entrance, Mr. Trump’s presence caused a stir. Bystanders craned their necks to get a good look. A waiter shattered a glass. Another waiter spilled a glass of water on this reporter’s purse.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="6221">Mr. Trump shook hands, accepted confections from dessert-bearing chefs — no lollipop trees, though — and took selfies. At one point, a man approached Mr. Trump and persuaded him to move to a spot near the bar, where several other men had requested a picture-taking session.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="6309">“These are true loyalists,” the man said as he took the real estate scion’s elbow.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="6673">Amid the din, Trump associates relaxed at separate tables. Carlos Gimenez Jr., a <a href="http://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/04/trump-consultant-and-miami-dade-mayors-son-joins-lewandowski-lobby-shop-111099">lawyer and sometime lobbyist</a> who worked for the Trump Organization, watched the scene unfold as he ate shrimp cocktail and drank vodka martinis with a Tampa socialite, Jill Kelley, who was part of the drama that led to the resignation of David H. Petraeus as C.I.A. director in 2012.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="103" data-total-count="6776">“He’s very generous with his time,” Mr. Gimenez said after he approached Eric Trump to say hello.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="7053">Holding court on a blue velvet sofa some yards away was Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital strategist. Mr. Parscale spends a couple of evenings a week at the hotel — no discounts, he said — meeting with vendors or keeping an eye on the journalists who circulate the room.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="176" data-total-count="7229">“I wouldn’t take my wife on a date there,” Mr. Parscale said later. “You can’t just sit around and just talk. When I’m in that lobby, I’m kind of like at work.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="7453">During his visits, Eric Trump was at work, too. In an email sent after his visit, he said that greeting everyone, including supporters and reporters who interrupt his macaroni and cheese, is just part of the family business.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="7735">“As to being approachable,” Mr. Trump wrote, “I am always happy to take a picture with a fan or a guest — aside from being a kind person, we are in the hospitality industry and a warm and friendly environment is really the core of our business and who we are as a family.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="7975" id="story-continues-11">Mr. Painter and other ethics experts say that is the gist of the problem — the hotel’s political appeal has turned it into one giant lily pad where tourists, lobbyists and foreign leaders can schmooze and win favor with Trump loyalists.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="8266">According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/trump-dc-hotel-turns-2-million-profit-in-four-months/2017/08/10/23bd97f0-7e02-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html">federal documents</a> reviewed by The Washington Post, hotel guests spent an average of $652.98 a night, one of the highest rates in Washington, and contributed to the roughly $2 million in profit the Trump Organization made from the hotel during the first four months of this year.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="278" data-total-count="8544">Some members of the Republican Party are happy to pump money into the business. According to recent Federal Election Commission filings, at least 22 Republican political campaigns have spent money at the hotel on lodging, food and event expenses since Mr. Trump was inaugurated.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="8864">Jennifer Watson, the chief of staff for Representative Tom Rice, Republican of South Carolina, said the congressman’s re-election campaign spent $1,200 on catering for an event at BLT Prime because of the appeal of a new steakhouse in a historic building. It was not, she said, because it was part of the Trump empire.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="9017">“You don’t see Trump, so I don’t think that’s the draw,” Ms. Watson said of the president. “It’s a new venue, and people want to try it.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="89" data-total-count="9106">Others say they visit because they hold political views that are unpopular in Washington.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="9304">“It’s kind of a safe zone for Trump supporters,” said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWzGRJfjaa_/?taken-at=1024936088">Rudy Pamintuan</a>, a Chicago-based consultant. “You don’t have to worry about strangers coming up and saying anything negative to you.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="9414">Linger long enough in the lobby, late enough at night, and you will almost always see the safe zone in action.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="9747" id="story-continues-13">Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, dropped by this month <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXbbFcVgta0/?taken-at=1024936088"> with Nigel Farage</a>, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, according to a local tipsheet <a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/playbook/2017/08/06/trump-in-bedminster-wh-wont-disclose-his-day-barack-and-michelle-at-rasika-chris-christie-in-canton-for-jerry-jones-pence-team-pushes-back-after-nyt-2020-piece-rob-salitermans-wedding-221717">curated by Politico</a>.
