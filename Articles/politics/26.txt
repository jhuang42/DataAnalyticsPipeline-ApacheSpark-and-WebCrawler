Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee’s chairman, accused Democrats of searching in vain for credible reasons to vote against Judge Gorsuch. “This nominee that we’re voting on today is a judge’s judge,” he said. “He’s a picture of the kind of justice we should have on the Supreme Court.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="1551" id="story-continues-3">Mr. Grassley suggested that some attacks in recent weeks from Democrats, which have included criticisms of the spending push from outside groups supporting Judge Gorsuch, defied the country’s values.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="1652" id="story-continues-5">“This is America,” he said, “where people can spend their money where they want to spend it.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="1842">Taking her turn next, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s top Democrat, criticized Judge Gorsuch’s record on workers’ rights and his reluctance to answer questions.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="62" data-total-count="1904">She did thank Mr. Grassley for overseeing the hearings fairly.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="2196">Ms. Feinstein also reminded the public about the treatment last year of Judge Merrick B.

Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the body’s longest-serving member.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="252" data-total-count="3062">He first suggested that Republicans’ treatment of Judge Garland last year had convinced Judge Gorsuch that “this committee is nothing more than a partisan rubber stamp,” allowing the nominee to evade straightforward questions during his hearings.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="3333">He said that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, had “promised to use whatever tactic is necessary to get his way, to make sure that Donald Trump’s nominee is confirmed, even if that means forever damaging the United States Senate.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="389" data-total-count="3722" id="story-continues-6">“Now, I respect this institution as much as anyone. I never expected to be here long enough to become the dean of the Senate,” Mr. Leahy said. “I’ve devoted myself to the good the Senate can accomplish.
