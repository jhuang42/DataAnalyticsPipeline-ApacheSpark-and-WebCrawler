Republicans have generally responded to various Trump-Russia revelations — like the Washington Post report disclosing that a wiretap of the Russian ambassador had picked up his conversations about sanctions with Michael Flynn, then Mr. Trump’s national security adviser — by saying the real scandal was the leaks.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="3686">Mr. Sessions told Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who chairs the committee, that the leaking of classified information was “a very grave offense.” He also said touted a significant increase in the number of open leak investigations.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="4025">“We had about nine open investigations of classified leaks in the last three years; we have 27 investigations open today,” Mr. Sessions said. “We intend to get to the bottom of these leaks.

It cannot be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to ensure it does not continue.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="4271">In August, Mr. Sessions had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/us/politics/jeff-sessions-trump-leaks-attorney-general.html">told reporters that the Justice Department was pursuing three times the number of leak investigations</a> as were open at the end of the Obama administration, but he had declined then to say what the specific numbers were.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="554" data-total-count="4825">(The numbers were also complicated by the fact that the department’s method of tracking such cases conflates leaks to the news media with other types of unauthorized disclosures, like foreign espionage. Mr. Sessions said in August, and again on Tuesday, that there have been four such indictments this year, but only one of those — the charging of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/us/politics/reality-winner-contractor-leaking-russia-nsa.html?_r=0">Reality Leigh Winner</a>, a contractor working for the N.S.A., with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/us/politics/reality-leigh-winner-leak-nsa.html">sending an intelligence report</a> about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election to The Intercept — is a classic news media leak case.)</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="5178">Later, Rep. Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, brought up Mr. Trump’s accusation that the press is the “enemy of the people,” said the Founders thought the free press was society’s best friend, and asked Mr. Sessions to commit to not prosecuting “investigative journalists for maintaining the confidentiality of their professional sources.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="358" data-total-count="5536">(That question garbled or conflated two different issues.

Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Sessions about that issue. Invoking the language of Fourth Amendment privacy rights, he noted that the information in the internet repository was seized without a warrant, and said querying the database amounts to a search.

Part of that is a cultural thing. I explained how when I became the United States attorney in 1981, and the drugs were being used widely, over a period of years, it became unfashionable, unpopular, and people were seeing — it was seen as such that good people didn’t use marijuana.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="11105">And with that, Mr. Cohen’s allotted time for questioning ended.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="11503">The White House was carefully watching Mr. Sessions’s performance.
