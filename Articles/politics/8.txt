The vote, along party lines, was 51-48. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, was the only one who was not present, as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/politics/john-mccain-cancer-tax-bill.html">returned home to receive medical treatment</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="1098" id="story-continues-3">As senators cast their final votes on the bill, with Vice President Mike Pence presiding, protesters rose in the gallery of the chamber and began chanting, “Kill the bill, don’t kill us.” They begged Republicans not to take away their health care and were escorted out.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="1251" id="story-continues-5">The vote came after hours of debate, during which Democrats raised strenuous objections about the bill’s cuts for corporations and wealthier Americans.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="1478">As the final vote approached in the Senate, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, gave his closing argument against the bill and scolded his Republican colleagues for talking during his remarks on the floor.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="1619">“This is serious stuff,” Mr. Schumer said. “We believe you’re messing up America. You could pay attention for a couple of minutes.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="1944">On the Senate floor, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin observed the proceedings, while Republicans and Democrats mingled among themselves. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona laughed as they spoke to each other, while shouting activists implored them to change their minds and vote the legislation down.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="2148">“I think this is an important accomplishment for the country that people will value and appreciate,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said at a news conference after the vote.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="2371">The House on Tuesday approved the most sweeping tax overhaul in decades, voting along party lines to enact deep and permanent tax cuts for corporations and temporary cuts for individuals.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="128" data-total-count="2499">The vote puts Republicans closer to final passage of the $1.5 trillion tax cut as the Senate prepares to vote on the final bill.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="2743" id="story-continues-6">However, the Senate parliamentarian has rejected three provisions from the Senate bill, saying they violate the so-called Byrd rule.

Legislative changes with no budgetary impact are not allowed in reconciliation bills. Items that have a nominal budget impact, but are mostly there for policy reasons, are also supposed to be struck, though that’s a more subjective standard. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/upshot/byrd-bath-seven-provisions-that-could-disappear-from-the-senate-health-bill.html">Here’s a refresher</a> for those interested in the so-called Byrd bath.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="3942">The 529 expansion was proposed by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, whose amendment during debate on the original Senate bill required a tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="4165">The parliamentary stumble does not imperil the overall tax rewrite, but the House will now need to vote again on the tax bill after the Senate gives its approval. The extra House vote is expected to take place on Wednesday.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="4366">Republicans are passing the tax overhaul using special budget rules that shield the bill from a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. But in doing so, they face restrictions on the contents of the bill.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="4492">Senator Patrick J.

Ryan of Wisconsin, speaking on the House floor, called the vote “a turning point” saying “this is our chance, this is our moment.” When the bill passed the House, a giddy Mr. Ryan smiled broadly and banged the gavel with force as he declared victory.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="6054">Passage of the bill came over the strenuous objections of Democrats in both the House and the Senate, who have accused Republicans of giving a gift to corporations and the wealthy and driving up the federal debt in the process. The final <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">vote tally can be found here</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="134" data-total-count="6188" id="story-continues-8">Twelve House Republicans also voted no on the bill, including lawmakers from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="487" data-total-count="6675">Under the bill approved by the House, the corporate tax rate would be cut to 21 percent, from the current 35 percent, a move that Republicans are betting will increase economic growth. Individuals would also see tax cuts, including a top rate of 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent. But the individual tax cuts would expire after 2025, a step that Republicans took to comply with budget rules that allow them to pass the tax overhaul using a simple majority, and without Democratic votes.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="6931">Republicans in Congress moved with remarkable speed to enact the biggest tax overhaul since 1986, unveiling legislation to rewrite the tax code, marshaling support for their effort and devising a compromise between the House and Senate in under two months.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="316" data-total-count="7247">Their success was a stark contrast with their effort this year to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a quest that was encumbered by internal divisions among Republicans and ultimately ended in humiliating failure. And it gives Mr. Trump a big accomplishment as the first year of his presidency nears an end.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="7452">Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a celebratory mood, told reporters at her briefing that the House vote put President Trump one step closer to delivering “tax cuts for Christmas.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="524" data-total-count="7976">She again said that the president would not release his tax returns, the only way that experts can determine precisely how the tax bill would impact his personal finances. The tax package, on the surface, appears hugely beneficial to the Trump family. It continues many favorable tax preferences for commercial real estate that were curtailed for other industries, cuts the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, and doubles the inheritance that Mr. Trump’s children can shield from taxation, to $22 million.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="8309">Capitol Police escorted a whole row of protesters out of the House chamber during the debate. Protesters yelled, “kill the bill, don’t kill us” and “shame, shame, shame.” Two additional protesters piped up during Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s speech, one questioning his ability to do math.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="8488">Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/us/politics/tax-bill-republicans.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Business%20Day&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article">told The New York Times</a> that he faced a “tough” decision in backing a tax bill that is projected to add to the deficit.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="8641">Mr. Corker had initially said he would oppose the final bill, then decided the $1.5 trillion tax cut was better for the nation than doing nothing at all.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="8838" id="story-continues-9">“It’s been really tough, especially because I did think, I really felt like we could have had a bipartisan bill that would have really withstood more fully the test of time,” Mr. Corker said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="9167">Still, theories about his switch continue to percolate. Some suggested Mr. Corker, who has said that he will not seek re-election to the Senate, may be rethinking his political future, while others asserted that he was bought off by a late-added provision that would benefit people with large real estate holdings, including him.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="9536">In an interview on Monday, Mr. Corker dismissed those theories and said he faced a wrenching decision as a Republican lawmaker with deep concerns about the country’s mounting debt and a strong desire to overhaul the tax code. In the end, he said, he put his fiscal principles aside on the assumption that the nation would be better off with the tax cuts than without.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="145" data-total-count="9712">Republicans might be preparing to celebrate the passage of their tax bill, but everyday taxpayers are not popping the champagne bottles just yet.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="9973">A new poll from <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2017/images/12/18/rel12a.-.trump.and.taxes.pdf">CNN and SSRS</a> found that the tax legislation continues to be unpopular with the general public, with 55 percent opposing the proposals and 33 percent supporting them.

Those voting no on Tuesday included 11 Republicans from the high-tax states of California, New York and New Jersey, where constituents could see their taxes go up because of a cap to the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT.
