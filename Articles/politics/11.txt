Republican voters are now more “guttural,” as Davis put it, more comfortable with Trump’s boastful, violent rhetoric and less connected to the cosmopolitan, modulated language of suburbia.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="3776">The deterioration of popular culture is a fact of life, as anyone who watches<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/10/25/family-hour-extinct-as-sitcoms-get-more-vulgar/"> television</a> <a href="http://w2.parentstv.org/Main/">knows</a>.

His emotional baggage and his political doctrine have already had an incalculable impact, and it is not a force for good.</p>]
