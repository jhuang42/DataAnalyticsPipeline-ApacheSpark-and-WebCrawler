Indeed, the Trump administration has instructed sheriffs to disregard federal law and detain undocumented immigrant suspects longer than a number of federal judges have said is constitutionally allowed.

No one in the state did it bigger or better than Sheriff Blakely. With a skybox selling for $650, the events have raised close to a million dollars for law enforcement and for reinvestment in rodeo operations, he estimated. Voters must take him at his word, because rodeo money is not among the nine revenue streams audited by the state, records show.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="10821">The Morgan County rodeo had been a smaller affair until Sheriff Franklin took office. She installed an A.T.M. just outside the gate, allowing people to pay cash not only for admission but for concessions. And she asked employees and volunteers to sell advertisements to local businesses. Before long, the ad book more than tripled in size.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="397" data-total-count="11218">Rick Sherman, a former deputy, said he sold ads while on duty. “I’m an armed law enforcement officer asking for money, and that’s never a good thing,” said Mr. Sherman, who left his job nearly two years ago after a falling-out with Sheriff Franklin. He said he had also been asked to work without pay at the rodeo. The sheriff said she did not force anyone to sell ads or work without pay.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="11616">Sheriff Franklin said the rodeo brought in about $20,000 a year in profit, but she has never publicly accounted for all the money, except to say that it went to local charities and law enforcement. She promised to produce financial records for her rodeo, but a month later gave only names of charities and no amounts. The rodeo’s financial records, she said, were “reviewed by a C.P.A. firm.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="11899">In interviews, the sheriff gave differing accounts about who processed the rodeo cash. First she said the money went through a tax-exempt organization set up a couple of years ago called Morgan County Sheriff’s Rodeo. Before that, the money was kept in a regular account, she said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="12153">After The Times could find no group by that name registered with the Internal Revenue Service, Sheriff Franklin corrected herself, saying rodeo proceeds had actually gone to a different nonprofit: Morgan County Sheriff’s Mounted Posse, founded in 1963.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="12567" id="story-continues-7">Normally, tax-exempt organizations must file annual financial reports for public inspection. But Sheriff Franklin’s is exempt from public disclosure because of an I.R.S. loophole for charities affiliated with government agencies. “The I.R.S. assumes organizations controlled by governmental entities will be good tax citizens,” said Marc Owens, former director of the I.R.S. division of exempt organizations.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="12725">The Times identified 19 such organizations — not all of them related to rodeos — affiliated with Alabama sheriffs.

One sheriff said his rodeo was a tax-exempt nonprofit, even though it is incorporated as a for-profit business.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="130" data-total-count="13162">The fact that sheriffs’ offices are handling large, unaudited sums of money has drawn the attention of government investigators.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="13404">That said, the value of rodeos for sheriffs in need of votes and money is considerable. Sheriff Blakely, Alabama’s rodeo king, is now in his third decade in office. Recently, the first three news items <a href="http://www.limestonesheriff.com/news.php">on his web</a><a href="http://www.limestonesheriff.com/news.php"> page</a> were rodeo promotions.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="13444">The fourth item — a major drug arrest.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="13747">The mere mention of Ms. Lockhart is enough to shear off Sheriff Franklin’s folksy veneer. A liar, a fabricator, a crazy woman: That is how she describes Ms. Lockhart. “I have never in my life heard of anything like this or been through anything like this,” the sheriff said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="13969">Ms. Lockhart stands by her postings. The diminutive grandmother became a whistle-blower after retiring as a security manager at the Redstone Arsenal, using her military research skills to shadow the sheriff and her allies.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="14249">Ms. Lockhart first took an interest in the sheriff after deputies came to her rural home in July 2011 to investigate a supposed disturbance. What happened next is in dispute, but she and her husband, Harold Lockhart, say the officers found nothing but refused to leave when asked.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="14569">Deputies arrested the couple after Mr. Lockhart, a retired military police officer, said he had had enough and was calling his lawyer. The Lockharts successfully sued the sheriff for false arrest. And while the sheriff was not present for the arrest and later said she knew nothing about it, Ms. Lockhart did not forget.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="14709">“I decided then I was not going to sit back and take it,” she said. “Some people can’t afford to fight it, so I started watching.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="14934" id="story-continues-8">With a profitable construction business, Ms. Lockhart had the resources to pursue complaints big and small. “I waited until employees were fired — then I would tell them I was the Morgan County Whistleblower,” she said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="15205">This year she even went so far as to hire a pilot to fly her over southern Alabama, where she videotaped a stretch of land that she believed the sheriff had secretly obtained for her horses. That suspicion, Sheriff Franklin says, is not backed by a scintilla of evidence.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="15380">There was, however, more than enough evidence to link the sheriff to Priceville Partners L.L.C., a get-rich-quick scheme that spread a toxic cloud over the business community.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="637" data-total-count="16017">A used-car dealership offering title loans, Priceville Partners had begun opening branches around the county, and investors were welcome. Ordinarily, law officers might investigate rather than invest in a business co-owned by the likes of Greg Steenson, who had done prison time for a multimillion-dollar check-kiting scheme. But several officers from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, along with Morgan County deputies, became financially involved, records show. One agent texted another asking if he wanted a one-month $7,000 profit on a $10,000 investment. Sheriff Franklin’s father worked there; her daughter did the bookkeeping.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="178" data-total-count="16195">The sheriff invested $150,000. She would later say that she had not known Mr. Steenson was a co-owner, even though her daughter said that was clear from her first day on the job.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="16552">Ms. Lockhart had begun blogging about the dealership in 2015, after noticing the proximity of the lawbreaker and the law enforcers. She was not the only one watching. So was the F.B.I. in Huntsville, which soon became a popular destination for those with stories to tell about the sheriff or the dealership. In local lingo, they “went across the river.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="16893">In January, after Ms. Lockhart published a copy of Sheriff Franklin’s $150,000 cashier’s check — signed over to Priceville Partners — the sheriff’s lawyer, Barnes F. Lovelace Jr., accused the blogger of obtaining it illegally. “A criminal investigation has been initiated,” he wrote to Ms. Lockhart. No charges have been filed.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="502" data-total-count="17395">The sheriff had once even threatened legal action against the creators of a Facebook page seeking “Justice for Aubie,” a golden retriever shot to death by deputies during a drug raid. She said that the dog had lunged at the officers, and that the page was intended to “inflame the public.” A petition with 1,600 signatures was sent to the Alabama Sheriffs Association, asking that officers be taught how to handle pets with nonlethal force. Amid fears of a lawsuit, the Facebook page came down.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="581" data-total-count="17976" id="story-continues-9">Sheriff Franklin’s mystery check was not so easily dismissed. According to The Decatur Daily, she said that the money had come from her savings and retirement accounts. Her lawyer later said it was invested in a “legitimate business,” a strange description for an enterprise whose co-owner, the felon Mr. Steenson, had recently been arrested on new charges — of theft and forgery involving the dealership. The district attorney said Mr. Steenson sold vehicles for which he had no title and then forged people’s names. (Priceville Partners filed for bankruptcy last year.)</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="18186">Sheriff Franklin eventually admitted the money had been withdrawn from an account earmarked for feeding inmates. For some Alabama sheriffs, that wouldn’t have posed a problem. But Morgan County was different.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="18277">Ana Franklin had her eyes on inmate food money even before she took office.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="18441">In preparing for her new job, she asked the county attorney if surplus food money would be hers to keep. His answer, according to press reports at the time, was no.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="444" data-total-count="18885">That sheriffs would be able to profit from inmate food money comes down to an unusual provision of Alabama law: In most counties — Morgan included — food money is deposited not into government accounts, but into sheriffs’ personal accounts. Nearly a decade ago, when inmates’ lawyers demanded to know how much of this money Alabama sheriffs were keeping for personal use, the state sheriffs’ association instructed them not to answer.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="19064">But while other sheriffs have legally kept the surplus money, Sheriff Franklin was bound by a federal consent decree that all her inmate food money be used for just that — food.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="451" data-total-count="19515">That court order stems from a legal action that the Southern Center brought against Sheriff Franklin’s predecessor, Greg Bartlett, who had been underfeeding inmates while taking $212,000 in food money for his personal use. In a signature moment as sheriff, Mr. Bartlett paid half-price for a truckload of unsold corn dogs and for three months fed them to inmates for breakfast, lunch and dinner, earning himself the sobriquet “Sheriff Corn Dog.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="19766">After the source of the $150,000 came to light, Sheriff Franklin said that because of bad legal advice, she had not realized she was violating the court order. Besides, she said, she had returned the money, and her prisoners received nutritious meals.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="442" data-total-count="20208" id="story-continues-10">Ms. Geraghty, the Southern Center lawyer, disagreed. She sent the sheriff a letter this year reporting inmate complaints of “reduced or watered-down portions,” and food that was frozen, had mold or contained rocks or, in one case, a nail. “During a recent meal at which chicken was served,” Ms. Geraghty wrote, “many inmates reportedly received cooking liquid from the pan in place of meat because the kitchen ran out of chicken.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="439" data-total-count="20647">Those complaints, the sheriff’s lawyer said, amounted to a tiny fraction of all meals served — a record any restaurant would be pleased with. Ms. Geraghty did not press her case, citing the “exceedingly low constitutional bar” required to satisfy the consent decree’s mandate for improved food. The food order was ultimately lifted, but not before a federal judge found Sheriff Franklin in contempt of court and fined her $1,000.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="20905">The sheriff’s office also did not comply with a judge’s order that an inmate not be allowed to work outside the jail because he posed a danger to the community. Sheriff Franklin said she had since changed jail policy to prevent that from happening again.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="21341">Sheriffs have found other ways to squeeze money out of inmates. Some take a percentage of service contracts, including commissary sales and telephone charges. In Morgan County, a company that just won the jail phone contract pays the county a 90 percent commission on all its revenue from prisoners’ calls. In St. Johns County, Fla., the sheriff brings in tens of thousands of dollars a year by charging inmates “processing fees.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="21514">In Morgan County, the sheriff oversees 19 different income streams and collects 25 percent of inmate wages. None of this money is supposed to personally benefit the sheriff.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="21674">Sheriff Franklin said she stayed within her budget, economizing, for example, by hanging inmate clothes on the line to dry. “It saved me $63,000,” she said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="22000">In October last year, armed with a warrant, the sheriff’s drug task force seized Ms. Lockhart’s computers and electronic devices, court records show. In preparing for the raid, the sheriff hired an unusual spy — Ms. Lockhart’s 19-year-old grandson, Daniel Lockhart, who aspired to work in law enforcement.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="22169">Mr. Lockhart said the sheriff’s technology expert had instructed him on how to plant spyware. The raid took place about a week after he said he installed the software.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="22517" id="story-continues-11">Mr. Lockhart had been living with his grandparents and working in their business. He gained access to the office after hours, he said, by telling Ms. Lockhart that his girlfriend needed an office computer for homework. Ms. Lockhart said she later discovered the spyware on her home computer as well and took it to the F.B.I., which has retained it.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="297" data-total-count="22814">The sheriff denied that the seizure was retaliatory, telling the news media, “Not until her personal agenda, her hatefulness and her vengeance to try and tear this office down, to take this office and myself down, and prepare for another election, did she cross the line of criminal activity.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="23036">But over a year later, Ms. Lockhart has yet to be charged, and says she broke no laws.
