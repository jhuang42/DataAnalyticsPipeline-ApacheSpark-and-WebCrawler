Gingrich put together the 22-page manifesto, “<a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/311828182/2016-Election-Principles#fullscreenhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/311828182/2016-Election-Principles">2016 Election Principles</a>,” at the request of the Republican National Committee.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="611">The document — in essence a master plan that comes with the strong endorsement of Reince Priebus, the chairman of the R.N.C. — stresses the need for “widespread inclusion of ethnic groups.” It sounds remarkably like an across-the-board renunciation of Donald Trump’s campaign strategy.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="831">This presents something of a paradox, though, because Gingrich claims to be one of Trump’s strongest supporters. In March, well before it was clear that Trump would go on to win the nomination, Gingrich told <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/03/newt_gingrich_discusses_the_merits_of_donald_trump.html">Slate</a> that</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="87" data-total-count="1126">Since then, Gingrich has made it official, telling Fox News’s <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/05/11/newt-gingrich-endorses-trump-london-new-muslim-mayor-doubles-down-on-trump/">Sean Hannity on May 11</a>:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="1501">Given the fact that it would be hard to imagine an approach to campaigning more diametrically opposed to Gingrich’s plan than what Trump has done so far, Gingrich’s enthusiasm for Trump appears almost inexplicable.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="1874" id="story-continues-1">Gingrich’s 2016 election proposal echoes the now familiar 2013 Republican “<a href="http://goproject.gop.com/">autopsy</a>,” also known as the Growth and Opportunity Project report, which warned Republicans that in the aftermath of President Obama’s second election victory they had to gain support among Hispanics, gays and women in order to remain competitive in national contests against the Democrats.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="458" data-total-count="2332" id="story-continues-3">But Trump won the Republican presidential nomination by appealing specifically to just those voters most opposed to “widespread inclusion of ethnic groups.” His core support in primary after primary has been white voters who rank highest on scales of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/opinion/campaign-stops/how-many-people-support-trump-but-dont-want-to-admit-it.html">ethnocentrism</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/opinion/campaign-stops/the-great-trump-reshuffle.html?_r=0">racial resentment</a>.

This translates to a Democratic loss in voter identification, over the past seven-and-a-half years, of 8.2 percentage points — a political bloodletting.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="467" data-total-count="6651">Then take three battleground states: Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/114016/state-states-political-party-affiliation.aspx">In 2008</a>, Gallup found partisan advantages favoring Democrats in these states by 18, 16 and 9 points respectively.

His 2016 victory plan, however, has a number of weaknesses.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="9200">First, while the Gallup data supports the Gingrich case that the Democratic Party is weaker than is widely recognized, the most recent findings from Gallup show Republican gains are grinding to a halt.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="9463">In an email to The Times, Jeffrey Jones, Gallup’s managing editor, wrote, “Our <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/190421/democrats-increasing-edge-party-affiliation.aspx">latest update on national party ID</a> showed things looking better for the Democrats.” Jones added that “as of now the short-term trends are moving in the Democratic direction.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="388" data-total-count="9851">A second point of weakness: Gingrich has argued that the Trump campaign is drawing new voters into the Republican Party. A <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-polling-turnout-early-voting-data-213897">detailed analysis that Politico</a> published on Tuesday, however, found that the turnout increase in primaries this year comes not from new Republican voters, but from voters who in the past eschewed state and local races and only cast ballots in the general election.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="10249">A third vulnerability: Gingrich claims that Republicans are on the cusp of a game-changing “revolution” in microtargeting through the use of a new technology called “Voter Score.” Voter Score is a database that ranks every voter in the nation on a series of 100 point scales for their likelihood of casting Republican or Democratic ballots, their stands on issues and their turnout history.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="94" data-total-count="10343">There are indications that Voter Score is not as revolutionary as Gingrich makes it out to be.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="10552">I sent Gingrich’s description of Voter Score to Laura Quinn, a former <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62770-2004Jul19_2.html">Democratic National Committee technology guru</a> who now runs <a href="http://www.catalist.us/">Catalist</a>, a Democratic list management firm. Her response was straightforward:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="10850"><a href="http://www.eitanhersh.com/">Eitan Hersh</a>, a political scientist at Yale who has written a book on political microtargeting, “<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/american-government-politics-and-policy/hacking-electorate-how-campaigns-perceive-voters">Hacking the Electorate</a>,” raised a number of questions about the value of Voter Score.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="11138" id="story-continues-6">To begin with, Hersh said, Democrats and liberals have been more willing to share key voter lists between candidates, parties and interest groups than Republicans have. He argues that since each user keeps adding new information to the list, the accuracy of the Democratic lists improves.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="11338">Hersh contends that a crucial factor in the development of microtargeting lists is a large volunteer force constantly going door to door and refining the quality of the list through hand-held devices.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="390" data-total-count="11728">In 2004, this worked well for Republicans because conservative and evangelical churches provided a massive base of workers for canvassing. In 2008 and 2012, however, Hersh said, neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney drew much enthusiasm from the Christian right. With fewer volunteers, the lists atrophied. The Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012, Hersh points out, were swamped with volunteers.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="11982">So far this year, Trump has shown little interest in building a volunteer-based “ground game,” and without such a network, Hersh suggests, the Republican Voter Score system will not undergo the constant updating required for a high-quality operation.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="12056">What can we conclude from the pluses and minuses of the Gingrich analysis?</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="12431">To some extent, Gingrich is right. Democrats are arguably too sanguine about the party’s demographic inevitability and its <a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-only-thing-that-matters/">Electoral</a> <a href="http://cookpolitical.com/presidential/charts/scorecard">College</a> <a href="http://rothenberggonzales.com/ratings/president">advantage</a>. That overconfidence may, in turn, lead to strategic errors in targeting states, making ad buys and other key tactical decisions. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-holds-slim-national-lead-over-donald-trump-poll-n574901">NBC’s most recent poll</a> gives Clinton just a three-point lead nationally, 48-45.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="12719">While Trump brings the risk of implosion to the campaign, with the potential to devastate the Republican Party, he also has the potential to win and to transform American politics for the foreseeable future. The odds favor implosion, but do not preclude the possibility of transformation.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="149" data-total-count="12868">Still, the Trump campaign is (and has been) playing a high-risk game, the opposite of the base-broadening, inclusive strategy Gingrich now calls for.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="13255">Trump’s presidential campaign will be the ultimate test of whether the Republican Party can survive as the nation’s bastion of revanchism — the party of racial reaction. The very fact that he is still afloat suggests that his backward-looking, white-dependent strategy may be more viable than those on the left, not to mention those on the traditional establishment right, believe.</p>]
