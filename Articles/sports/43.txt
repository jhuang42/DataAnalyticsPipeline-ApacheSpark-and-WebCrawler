Mallozzi</span></p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Kathleen Ann Colello and Mark Wayne Nixon are to be married Nov. 26 at the Holy Family Retreat Center in West Hartford, Conn. The Rev. David Cinquegrani, a Roman Catholic priest, is to perform the ceremony.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The bride, 65, is a marketing and development specialist at Holy Family Retreat Center and a senior remote booth coordinator for ESPN throughout New England. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Hartford.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">She is the daughter of the late Mary E. Colello and the late John A.

The bride’s father retired as an electronics inspector at Hamilton Standard, an aircraft propeller parts supplier in Windsor Locks.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The groom, 59, is the owner of the Stark’s Express trucking company in East Hartford, Conn.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">He is a son of Barbara L. Nixon of East Hartford and the late Robert B. Nixon. The groom’s mother is retired as the office manager of Stark’s Express, which was founded and operated by his father.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The groom’s first marriage ended in divorce.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The couple met in April 2008, shortly after both had attended the Central Connecticut Golf Meetup, part of an online service that brings together people with a common interests. Ms. Colello wanted to learn how to play the game. Mr. Nixon, an avid golfer, said he wanted “to find partners to play with, and to take advantage of some extra time on my hands since I was divorced and already had two grown children.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">But what Mr. Nixon found was Ms. Colello, who had arrived on the first day with plenty of determination, but no golf clubs.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“I had taken golf lessons and been to the driving range many times, but I wasn’t at the point yet where I was going to make an investment in my own set of clubs, plus I thought the league would provide them,” Ms. Colello said. “So I asked other people in the group if anyone was willing to share their clubs with me.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Mr. Nixon stepped up. “She seemed friendly, and she was a very pretty woman with blonde hair,” Mr. Nixon said. “We stayed together and played nine holes. It was fun.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Ms. Colello was also satisfied with her first round with Mr. Nixon.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“I thought he was cute,” she said. “He was wearing a New York Yankees baseball shirt, and I’m a big Yankees fan, so that was a big plus.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The following week, Ms. Colello arrived at the course yet again with no clubs — “It was a busy week, and I hadn’t had a chance to buy them” she said — and yet again Mr. Nixon swung into action.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“He was just the sweetest guy,” she said. “We talked and we golfed and I just found him to be very nice, and he had a great sense of humor and was very attractive.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The next time Ms. Colello arrived at the course she had her own set of clubs, and an invitation to go out for drinks along with other members of the league, including Mr. Nixon.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“There were about eight of us that went to a little bar in Hartford,” said Mr. Nixon, who was living in South Windsor, Conn., at the time. “We talked and had a few drinks, and at the end of the night, when we went to say good night, I just kissed her.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Ms. Colello, who was living in New Britain, Conn., began dating Mr. Nixon casually, and within a year, they were dating steadily.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“I was very shocked to learn that someone this sweet and caring and beautiful was single her whole life,” Mr. Nixon said. “But she was one of the those people who always said, ‘If it’s not right I’m not going to do it.’ ”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">They dated for three years, Mr. Nixon said, before the pressures of making another serious commitment gave him pause.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“I really loved her, but things were moving a little too fast for me at that point,” he said. “I kind of pushed her away.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">They broke up for about a year, “and then one day out of the blue,” Mr. Nixon said, “she called me to ask if I would go along with her to find a new car.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">They were soon back together again, on the road to marriage. “I was so glad we got back together, because we are really a good fit,” Mr. Nixon said.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Ms. Colello was equally thrilled. “I waited a long time to get married, and I don’t think I was that picky,” Ms. Colello said, laughing.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“But now I’ve found my soul mate, my best friend, someone who’s honest and who will do anything for me, someone I can talk to about anything and feel safe with,” she added.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“He was someone definitely worth waiting for.”</p>,>Advertisement</p>,class="css-12lb1tb"></p>,class="css-1ft1ynw"></p>,class="css-whjxzo"></p>,class="css-13sbuc">Collapse</p>,class="css-hlo4bz">SEE MY OPTIONS</p>]
