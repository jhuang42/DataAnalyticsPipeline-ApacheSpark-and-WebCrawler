The city is “really one of the most exciting birding spots in all of North America,” he said. “Birders come far and wide specifically during spring migration.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">During an outing last week with three guides from New York City Audubon, we started at the Grand Army Plaza station (the 2 and 3 lines) and wove our way across Prospect Park to end at the Prospect Park stop (the B, Q, S lines).</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Despite the winds and less-than-ideal afternoon timing (it’s best to go birding in the morning and late afternoon), we spotted some plump, bright orange <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/northern-cardinal" target="_blank" title="">Northern Cardinals</a>, heard the meowlike calls of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.audubon.org/birds-of-america/cat-bird" target="_blank" title="">Cat Bird</a> and spent several minutes watching a brown, speckle-bellied <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/swainsons-thrush" target="_blank" title="">Swainson’s Thrush</a> hop around near a small waterfall.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">And the city’s birding community embraces newcomers. There’s a “social component to bird watching,” said Kellye Rosenheim, a co-author of “Birdwatching in New York City and on Long Island.” “Bird-watching leads to all different kinds of conversations.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">But she also recommends venturing on your own: “There’s nothing like being in the woods by yourself, trying to figure what that bird is and digging deep.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Other popular places for birding include Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx (the 1 to its namesake stop) and Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Queens (the A to Broad Channel).</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Happy birding.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Here’s what else is happening:</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">A drippy week ahead — highs will hover <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&amp;lon=-73.96940231323242#.WSKcSI61vfb" target="_blank" title="">in the 60s</a>, but things will stay wet.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Expect showers as you head to work today, and a possible thunderstorm during those morning meetings.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Here’s hoping the rain doesn’t leak into our Memorial Day weekend.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz euv7paa0">• </strong>After 146 years, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus took its final bow.
