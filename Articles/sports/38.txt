Before the 1960s, it did. You can thank R. Raleigh D’Adamo for the map being color coded by route.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Until 1940, when the subway system was taken over by the city’s Board of Transportation, a predecessor of the current Metropolitan Transportation Authority, three companies operated subway trains. The map used three colors to show which company ran each route.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">In 1964, recognizing that the tricolor maps needed an update, the city’s transit authority held a public contest for a redesign. Mr. D’Adamo, a lawyer and self-described transit aficionado, entered with a map that gave each route a different color.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“I wrote that the maps were trying to do too much work with too few colors,” Mr. D’Adamo said recently about the report he submitted with his design, which had seven colors.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Mr. D’Adamo’s entry, along with two others, won first place. The winning designs were given to the transit authority, and the color-by-route concept was incorporated into an official redesign of the map by 1967. All <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/27/nyregion/new-ny-subway-map.html" target="_blank" title="">versions of the subway map</a> since have been based on color coding by route.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Mr. D’Adamo’s original map never became official, partly because the contest rules had demanded a geographically accurate layout of the city, but the transit authority later decided to go with a design where the geography was more loosely depicted, Mr. D’Adamo said.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">His original map was lost, he said.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">But while cleaning out old boxes in 2014, Mr. D’Adamo found a color photograph of his map. He collaborated with the graphic designer Reka Komoli and the historian Peter B. Lloyd, who is writing a book about the history of New York’s subway system, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2015/03/a-lost-design-for-a-nyc-subway-map-rediscovered/387424/" target="_blank" title="">to digitally restore</a> the map.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">In the years between the contest and the map’s rediscovery, Mr. D’Adamo found his calling — in transportation. After winning the contest, he quit his job as a lawyer and joined the M.T.A., where he worked for five years before becoming Westchester County’s first commissioner of transportation.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“This contest came along, and it made me realize that while I was happy at law, I’d be happier following my hobby,” he said recently. “I think I was born on a subway train or something.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Here’s what else is happening:</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">If April showers bring May flowers, then June showers must bring a much-needed reprieve from the humidity.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">In any case, we’re in for a sunny day, with humidity plunging after the early morning. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&amp;lon=-73.96940231323242#.VdxDPdNVikr" target="_blank" title="">The high is expected to be 85</a>.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Dry off while you can: We may get more showers tomorrow.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">• When transit systems misfire, subway and rail workers bear the brunt of riders’ frustration.
