And while the Warriors could certainly look to that team for inspiration in how to remain dominant once the playoffs roll around, the executives who make Golden State’s personnel decisions may want to look to the years immediately before Chicago’s finest season for a blueprint of how to turn their domination of the N.B.A. into a full-fledged dynasty.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">By the time the Bulls were racing to an N.B.A.-record 72 wins in 1996, a lot of faces from the team’s most recent championship, their third in a row three seasons earlier, were gone. Bill Cartwright, Horace Grant, B. J. Armstrong, Scott Williams and John Paxson had become Luc Longley, Dennis Rodman, Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc and Steve Kerr. In fact, only two players remained from the 1992-93 team: Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Sentimentality rarely plays a role in roster building, but the Bulls did something far more extreme than decline to retain a veteran or two; they burned the house down, keeping only its two pillars.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">While it is premature to refer to the Warriors, with just one title under their belt, as a dynasty, the planning to create one will have to begin soon.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The current Warriors, while not exactly the mirror image of the 72-win Bulls, have plenty of parallels in personnel: the league’s dominant scorer (Jordan and Stephen Curry); an All-Star wing who excels on both ends of the court (Pippen and Klay Thompson); an outstanding power forward who does the dirty work (Rodman and Draymond Green); a big center who clogs the middle and does not worry about scoring (Longley and Andrew Bogut); a player who hits open shots resulting from the space the dominant scorer creates (Kerr and Harrison Barnes); and savvy veteran guards who do not fill a stat sheet but help in numerous ways (Harper and Shaun Livingston).</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The key for the Warriors, regardless of whether they win a second title this season, will be determining who is expendable, because over the next few seasons, players will only age and salaries will only increase, which will make it impossible to keep the roster intact.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The core of Curry, Thompson and Green seems stable. Thompson is signed through 2018-19 and Green through 2019-20. The Warriors will undoubtedly offer a maximum-salary contract to Curry under the new cap terms when he becomes a free agent after next season.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The tricky part is figuring out who else is vital to their success and who could be replaced by younger and cheaper options.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Among the first decisions will be what to do with Barnes, the team’s top pick in the 2012 draft and a fairly reliable, if not particularly exciting, offensive weapon. He averages just 11.4 points and 4.9 rebounds a game but is vital to the team’s so-called death ball lineup, when Green shifts to center and Golden State runs its opponents into submission.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">At 23, Barnes is one of the team’s youngest players, but his status as a restricted free agent this off-season may force the issue. If Bogut is correct that another team will offer Barnes a max contract, the Warriors would have to at least consider letting him walk rather than committing that much money to what is essentially their fourth option.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Beyond Barnes, the Warriors also have to contend with free agency this off-season for Festus Ezeli, Marreese Speights and Leandro Barbosa, while Andre Iguodala, Bogut and Livingston, all on the wrong side of 30, have one year left on their deals. Looming over all of it is the persistent rumor that Kevin Durant would consider signing with them as a free agent if they could create room under the salary cap.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">It is hard to say which players would be the biggest losses in terms of chemistry for a team that on several levels sacrifices individual acclaim for team gain, or how a superstar like Durant could adapt to Golden State’s team-first approach. But if the Warriors use the greatest dynasty of the last 30 years as their model for success, they could enter the 2019-20 season with just two or three players from their current roster. Provided Curry is still around and the team is still winning, the lack of continuity would not cost the team the dynasty label. Just ask the Chicago Bulls.</p>,class="css-a7r3oz etcg8100"></p>,>Advertisement</p>,class="css-12lb1tb"></p>,class="css-1ft1ynw"></p>,class="css-whjxzo"></p>,class="css-13sbuc">Collapse</p>,class="css-hlo4bz">SEE MY OPTIONS</p>]
