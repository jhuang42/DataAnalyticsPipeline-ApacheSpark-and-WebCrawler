Here’s our live coverage and analysis from Moscow.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="286"><strong>Group A:</strong> Russia, Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="325"><strong>Group B:</strong> Portugal, Spain, Iran, Morocco</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="366"><strong>Group C:</strong> France, Peru, Denmark, Australia</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="411"><strong>Group D:</strong> Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, Nigeria</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="48" data-total-count="459"><strong>Group E:</strong> Brazil, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Serbia</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="504"><strong>Group F:</strong> Germany, Mexico, Sweden, South Korea</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="42" data-total-count="546"><strong>Group G:</strong> Belgium, England, Tunisia, Panama</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="587"><strong>Group H:</strong> Poland, Colombia, Senegal, Japan</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="883">■ <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>England</strong> and <strong>France</strong> got favorable draws. <strong>Portugal</strong> will play its neighbor <strong>Spain</strong> in Group B, and <strong>Argentina</strong> drew one of the tougher first-round groups, as it was paired with Croatia, Iceland and Nigeria. <strong>Mexico</strong>, the Concacaf champion, will play <strong>Germany</strong>, Sweden and South Korea in Group F.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="971" id="story-continues-1"><strong>Teams</strong><strong>:</strong> Russia, Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="1310">From Rory Smith in Moscow: The opening game of the World Cup will be Russia against Saudi Arabia: or, to put it another way, the two worst teams in the tournament, according to the FIFA rankings. The group is quite nicely balanced, though: Uruguay will expect to make the last 16, but both Russia and Egypt will have hopes of joining them.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="37" data-total-count="1398"><strong>Teams</strong><strong>:</strong> Portugal, Spain, Iran, Morocco</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="1686">From Rory Smith: Not as bad as it might have been for Portugal and Spain. Both will expect to make it through — though Morocco is not to be underestimated — in a group that also includes Iran. Finishing on top here might prove crucial as the tournament’s knockout round takes shape.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="1766" id="story-continues-3"><strong>Teams:</strong> France, Peru, Denmark, Australia</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="2015">From Rory Smith: If France had imagined an ideal group, it would have been this. Peru was among the weakest of the second seeds, Australia does not have a coach, and Denmark should not trouble them too much. Second place could be intriguing, though.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="2113"><strong>Teams</strong><strong>:</strong> Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, Nigeria</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="2442">From Rory Smith: Probably the most delicately balanced, most interesting, and most competitive of all the groups. Argentina only just qualified, Croatia has an abundance of individual talent, Iceland a tremendous collective strength and Nigeria was, possibly, the toughest fourth seed to draw. Argentina will not be happy at all.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="46" data-total-count="2526"><strong>Teams</strong><strong>:</strong> Brazil, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Serbia</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="2859">From Rory Smith: Brazil will not be nearly as happy as France, however. Serbia, Switzerland and Costa Rica is a relatively kind section for Tite’s team. The battle to join them in the last 16 will be absolutely fascinating, however: there is not much between those three teams. And there may not be many goals between them, either.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="2950"><strong>Teams</strong><strong>:</strong> Germany, Mexico, Sweden, South Korea</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="3150">From Rory Smith: Like France and Brazil, Germany has nothing to complain about: Sweden is hard-working but limited, and neither South Korea nor Mexico have the quality to derail the reigning champion.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="3239"><strong>Teams</strong><strong>:</strong> Belgium, England, Tunisia, Panama</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="265" data-total-count="3504">From Rory Smith: It should be a straight shootout between England and Belgium to see who claims the top spot and, with it, a theoretically easier second-round fate. The main advantage Panama and Tunisia have is that both will, to some extent, be unknown quantities.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="39" data-total-count="3588"><strong>Teams</strong><strong>:</strong> Poland, Colombia, Senegal, Japan</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="3841">From Rory Smith: Along with Group A, Group H seems the most evenly spread. Poland was among the weakest top seeds, and Colombia will harbor ambitions of finishing first. Japan and Senegal, though, will both see the Round of 16 as a real possibility now.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="4168" id="story-continues-4">No United States, so no World Cup for you?

We are saturated with soccer now: We can watch all of the world’s best players every week.

That’s controversial, because the rankings are far from universally accepted as the most accurate ordering of teams. The most contentious issue is that friendly games count in the rankings, although they are worth fewer points. Because team’s positions are based on average points per match, teams that play a lot of friendlies are penalized. Several sides, including Poland, seem to have gamed the system by playing fewer friendlies, which helped their ranking.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="98" data-total-count="10892">So before you ask: That’s why Poland, a fine team but hardly a tournament favorite, is in Pot 1.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="11114">■ The draw will take much longer than it needs to take.
