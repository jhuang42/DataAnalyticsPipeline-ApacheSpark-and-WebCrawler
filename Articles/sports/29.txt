A young man, wearing a black leather jacket and chomping on gum, leaned against the engraving and fiddled with his cellphone.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">If there is a treasure there, he and everyone else on the busy sidewalk that day will most likely never find out.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The capsule believed to contain the Ruth baseball is supposed to stay closed until April 2130 — 200 years after the cornerstone-laying ceremony, according to news reports about the event. And it is impossible to know whether the baseball has survived behind the facade — and if so, whether it can last 113 more years. There is even a chance that it was never sealed into the cornerstone in the first place.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Although several newspapers reported that a baseball signed by Ruth had been placed there, executives connected to the store today, including a Bloomingdale descendant, said they had never heard of it.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">John Ernst, 76, whose grandfather Samuel J. Bloomingdale spoke at the ceremony in 1930, said that he did not remember hearing stories about the cornerstone and that the family, as far as he knew, had no records of the event.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“This goes back so far,” said Ernst, a managing member of B. Bros. Realty, which owns the store’s building and the land beneath it, “it kind of got lost.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Anne Keating, a Bloomingdale’s spokeswoman, said some current company executives were aware of a time capsule but didn’t know what was inside until this spring.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Last summer, Laurie Gwen Shapiro, an author who was researching a book about Richard Byrd’s expedition to Antarctica from 1928 to 1930, came across a news clipping about the Bloomingdale’s ceremony as she pored over brittle scrapbooks in New York libraries.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“I saw the words ‘Babe Ruth baseball,’ and I thought, ‘That’s crazy!’” she said. She wrote about her discovery on the website <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://untappedcities.com/2016/07/27/two-time-capsules-hidden-in-bloomingdales-include-a-baseball-signed-by-babe-ruth-and-more/" target="_blank" title="">Untapped Cities</a>.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Newspaper accounts about the ceremony described two boxes left in the cornerstone, one containing prosaic items like coins and newspapers, another filled with what The Herald Tribune called “an unusual miscellany.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">That second box, newspapers said, was supposed to include the Ruth ball, a golf ball signed by Bobby Jones, a horseshoe, a radio set, a wedding ring, a cocktail shaker, a piece of talking picture film and predictions of the future written by prominent Americans. Among those invited to offer predictions, The Herald Tribune said, were President Calvin Coolidge, who had left office the year before, as well as Henry Ford, Florenz Ziegfeld and Ruth.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">That collection, said Nick Yablon, a cultural historian and professor at the University of Iowa, was effectively a time capsule, although the term was not formally used until 1938.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The tradition of placing objects into cornerstones dates to the Mesopotamians, who tucked gems and messages to the future into building foundations, according to Knute Berger, a founder of the International Time Capsule Society.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">But never, Berger said, had he heard of a cornerstone containing an artifact “as Holy Grail-ish” as a baseball autographed by Ruth.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">If the ball is there and well preserved, it could be the most valuable single-signed baseball ever — worth as much as $500,000 at auction, said Leila Dunbar, an appraiser of sports memorabilia, and Mike Heffner, the president of Lelands.com, a sports memorabilia auction house.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The highest price on record is $388,375, for the 2012 sale of another ball signed by Ruth, according to the website of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.psacard.com/" target="_blank" title="">Professional Sports Authenticator</a>, a memorabilia authentication service.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Balls autographed by Ruth are not especially rare. In fact, Dunbar said, he “ushered in the era of professional athlete signing.” But she said the Bloomingdale’s ball would gain value from “perfect provenance” — the remarkable back story of its many years in hiding and the fact that it dates to 1930, when Ruth was at the peak of his fame.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Ruth was 35 that season and still putting up huge numbers: He ended up <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ruthba01.shtml" target="_blank" title="">hitting .359</a> with 49 home runs and 153 runs batted in for a Yankees team that finished third in the American League.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“He was probably the best known person in America,” Dunbar said, “probably even better than the president.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">She and Heffner both said that being sealed off from the world would improve the chances of a ball’s remaining in excellent condition. One reason, Heffner said, is that it would not have been exposed to light, which is harmful to signatures.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Other items reportedly in the capsule could also be worth six figures. A ball signed by Jones, who won golf’s Grand Slam in 1930, would be extremely rare and possibly worth up to $100,000, Dunbar said. And Heffner said the predictions, especially if they were handwritten and accurate, could be “almost priceless.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">But time capsule experts say water could have seeped into the container, causing damage. “There are plenty of examples of people digging up time capsules, and everything’s crumbled to dust,” Berger said. Or, he said, valuable items could have been stolen before the capsule was sealed into the cornerstone.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">In 2001, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/time-capsule-opening-reveals-nothing-1.401346 https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/the-time-capsule-that-never-was-1.1053439" target="_blank" title="">The Irish Times</a>, a granite box discovered by archaeologists in the foundation of a former monument in Dublin — and thought to contain historic coins — was opened to much anticipation, only to be found empty.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Keating, the Bloomingdale’s spokeswoman, said in May that the cornerstone had never been altered and that coming renovations would not affect it. And now that the company has become aware of the reports from 1930, she said, “we have no plans to open the cornerstone until it was planned to be opened.”</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">To investigate whether there is anything inside, Jorge Otero-Pailos, the director of historic preservation at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, has suggested methods like ground-penetrating radar and thermal imaging.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Not surprisingly, Keating said Bloomingdale’s would not allow such exploration.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">So the mystery remains, probably unsolvable for generations. Otero-Pailos can see something valuable in that, too. It stokes the imagination, he said, to know that a ball autographed by Ruth could be just beyond a piece of stone on a New York street corner.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">“It makes you look behind the surface of things,” he said. “To see the city with an inquiring eye and to say, ‘What could be there?’”</p>,class="css-a7r3oz etcg8100"></p>,class="css-a7r3oz etcg8100"></p>,>Advertisement</p>,class="css-12lb1tb"></p>,class="css-1ft1ynw"></p>,class="css-whjxzo"></p>,class="css-13sbuc">Collapse</p>,class="css-hlo4bz">SEE MY OPTIONS</p>]
