Alexander, Ms. Hao challenged the position generally favored by American politicians.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="388" data-total-count="1648">Referring to the Arab Spring, Ms. Hao — now the deputy director of the China Institute for Innovation and Development Strategy — warned that taking away developing countries’ ability to control public opinion through Internet controls and surveillance would result not in more openness, but instead in “blood” and “hatred,” according to an <a href="http://news.cyol.com/2015fhzhibo.html" title="Chinese language transcript.">official transcript</a> of her speech.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="265" data-total-count="1913" id="story-continues-1">Though Ms. Hao ultimately called for greater communication between the world’s two largest economies, she also said the United States should be less imperious in dictating how governments of other countries manage their own Internet, and in general behave online.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="2250" id="story-continues-3">“America spreads the ideas of democracy widely across the world, but in cyberspace, it’s the opposite,” she said. “The United States continuously maintains a system to monitor the rest of the world but asks other countries to strictly control themselves and remain within bounds. This unsymmetrical line of thinking continues.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="2525">Ms. Hao and Mr. Alexander, whose speech largely called for cooperation between the United States and China on the shared threat of online attacks, both spoke as part of the China Internet Security Conference sponsored by the Chinese online security and search firm Qihoo 360.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="2742">Likening China and the United States to strangers walking in the dark who mistake each other for ghosts, Ms. Hao said it was critical for each country to stop demonizing the other and instead begin a broader dialogue.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="135" data-total-count="2877">Ms. Hao also said any new rules of engagement for online attacks would probably be different from those used in other forms of warfare.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="3041">“Because of the complexities and uncertainties of cyberspace, many of the rules of engagement applied normally would be difficult to directly follow,” she said.</p>]
