Shares had surged 48 percent on Feb. 7, to $20.75, topping Snap's IPO price of $17 for the first time in months, on hopes that the redesign was working. The stocks has mostly fallen since.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"The redesign didn't just make users unhappy, it also made advertisers more concerned," said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. "Thatâ€™s not a good position to be in." </p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">On the plus side, Williamson said, "Snapchat loyalists are highly engaged, using the app multiple times per day. And Snapchat's ad formats are still among the most creative."</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">For the quarter ended in March, total revenue rose 54 percent from the same period a year earlier to $230.7 million in what was Snap's fifth quarterly earnings as a public company. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $244.5 million.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Company executives acknowledged that the new design hurt results but said they were sticking with the plan to keep content from friends separate from other publishers. The approach will propel growth in the long run, they said.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both," Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said on a conference call with analysts.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption."</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The redesign was meant to draw in a broader audience, but sparked criticism from users including celebrities Kylie Jenner and Chrissy Teigen. The changes also created some "apprehension" among advertisers, Spiegel said.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said the bad publicity surrounding the redesign made some advertisers rethink their use of Snapchat.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"When there is a lot of negative news in the press every day, it does give people pause," Khan said, saying that Snapchat will counter that by providing better measurements of return on investment.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">User growth at the company's disappearing-message app has repeatedly fallen short of Wall Street's expectations since its heavily hyped initial public offering in March last year.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The Venice, California-based firm posted a net loss of $385.8 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, a year earlier.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Snap's adjusted loss per share of 17 cents was in line with analyst expectations.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"> (Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Leslie Adler)</p>,>Advertisement</p>,class="css-12lb1tb"></p>,class="css-1ft1ynw"></p>,class="css-whjxzo"></p>,class="css-13sbuc">Collapse</p>,class="css-hlo4bz">SEE MY OPTIONS</p>]
