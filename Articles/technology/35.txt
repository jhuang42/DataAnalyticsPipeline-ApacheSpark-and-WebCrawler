For a long time, Amazon did not pay state sales tax, but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it. It is the case, however, that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform. As for the United States Postal Service, Amazon’s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-contract-with-usps-fact-checking-trumps-tweet-about-amazon-and-the-post-office/">package shipping revenue</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="1310" id="story-continues-3">Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon’s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="1411">But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="1659">Amazon accounts for only <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/03/amazon-grabbed-4-percent-of-all-us-retail-sales-in-2017-new-study.html">4 percent</a> of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart’s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon’s footing in the grocery business is still small.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="1747">All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="2071">Amazon also has a loyal customer base — it has an <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/150f9af2201/d8e982eb-fcc7-41b4-bd58-eba64185962d.pdf">estimated</a> 90 million Prime members — and the public views it <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-poll-facebook-favorability-plunges-1522057235-b1fa31db-e646-4413-a273-95d3387da4f2.html">relatively favorably</a>.

In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That’s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="2695">But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="2710"><em>— Peter Eavis</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="3000">The investment adviser to New York City’s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook’s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html">improper harvesting of information from 50 million users</a> of the social network.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="3208" id="story-continues-4">New York City’s comptroller, Scott M.

On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="7434">But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm.
