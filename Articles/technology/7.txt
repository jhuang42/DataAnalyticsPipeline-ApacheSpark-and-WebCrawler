A winged craft traces the air, mapping a field with pinpoint accuracy for his start-up, a <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/unmanned_aerial_vehicles/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about unmanned aerial vehicles.">drone</a> software company called <a href="https://botlink.com/" title="Company website.">Botlink</a>. “They like drones, but they’ve got a steep learning curve ahead.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="754">For years, entrepreneurs have come here to farm and to drill for <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about oil.">oil</a> and natural gas. Now a new, tech-savvy generation is grabbing a piece of the growing market for drone technology and officials want to help them do it here, where there is plenty of open space and — unlike in other sparsely populated states — lots of expertise already in place.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="365" data-total-count="1119">Silicon Valley has the big money and know-how, Mr. Muehler and others say, but North Dakota can take unmanned aerial vehicles, as the officials prefer to call drones, from a fast-growing hobby to an industry. And just as Silicon Valley got its start with military contracts, entrepreneurs and cooperative universities, they believe they can do the same with drones.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="1307">“The potential up here is tremendous,” said Jack Dalrymple, the state’s governor. “It’s not about supporting a company or two; it’s creating the leading edge of an industry.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="1639" id="story-continues-1">North Dakota has spent about $34 million fostering the state’s unmanned aerial vehicle business, most notably with a civilian industrial park for drones near Grand Forks Air Force Base. The base, a former Cold War installation, now flies nothing but robot aircraft for the United States military and Customs and Border Protection.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="1919" id="story-continues-3">Right now, private sector drones are where personal computers were in the 1970s: a hobbyist technology waiting to become mainstream. The technology research firm Gartner says that, barring regulatory hurdles, the United States drone business could be worth $7 billion in a decade.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="2221" id="story-continues-5">Companies are moving fast. Last month, Amazon <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/drone-videos-could-help-amazon-sell-prime-subscriptions/" title="Bits blog post.">released a video</a> showing its planned delivery drone, and companies like Google and Facebook are working on big drone projects. DJI, a Chinese company that is the world’s largest maker of small drones, was funded last spring at a valuation of $10 billion.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="2582">Small drones may bedevil cities with privacy concerns, even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/white-house-drone.html" title="Times article.">landing on the White House lawn</a>, but rural states with farming, <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about oil.">oil</a> and rail lines see many practical reasons to put robots in the sky. Infrared imaging can judge crop health. Cameras can spot leaks and cracks in pipelines. Smaller copters can inspect windmill blades. Livestock can be located easily.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="2779">Judging from Mr. Muehler’s proving grounds, if the occasional experimental craft crashes, it is unlikely to hit much beyond dirt. And with money, expertise and need here, people will keep trying.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="3006">Grand Forks Air Force Base, 80 miles north of Fargo, has been an all-drone base since 2013.

Involta, an Iowa-based operator of data centers that has already created a windmill inspection business in Grand Forks, is looking at building facilities specialized in collecting aerial information.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="4344">A company called Field of View, near the planned site of the industrial park, makes aerial sensing equipment. An outfit called the Unmanned Applications Institute is working with providers away from North Dakota on things like local drone manufacture and warehousing.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="358" data-total-count="4702">Nearby, the University of North Dakota, which already trains many of the nation’s commercial pilots and the air traffic controllers of some 18 countries, has 200 students learning to fly drones in a four-year program that started in 2009; 61 students have graduated from it. North Dakota State University, in Fargo, has also started teaching drone courses.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="5053">Besides military contracts and educational talent, North Dakota also has high-tech talent. In 1999, Amazon purchased an online seller of tools and home improvement gear in Grand Forks, and the company now develops customer service software there. In 2001, Microsoft paid $1.1 billion for Great Plains Software of Fargo, and it now has an office there.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="5164">The area has thousands of software engineers and not a few millionaires itching to get into the next big thing.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="124" data-total-count="5288">“Every top engineer in all of Fargo works for Botlink,” Mr. Muehler boasted. “We have the top 10 engineers in town.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="5611">Mr. Muehler, who was educated as a pilot at North Dakota State, started on what became Botlink while flying missions from the brick building in Fargo. Governor Dalrymple refers to the military site as “once a well-kept-secret facility,” since its purpose has become common knowledge in the city of about 115,000 people.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="5811">One night in early 2014, Mr. Muehler saw a report on Fox News about a hobbyist drone that flew into the airspace at La Guardia Airport in New York.

Seven months later, he spoke at a meeting of local entrepreneurs and collected $500,000 in angel funding from local investors. Botlink was formed several months later when Mr. Muehler met Terri Zimmerman, a former chief financial officer at Great Plains who grew up on a farm near the Canadian border.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="6593">“We want to be the Microsoft of the industry,” said Ms. Zimmerman, who is now Botlink’s chief executive, and runs another company, Packet Digital, involved in low-power semiconductors used for, among other things, military drones.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="6734">So far, the company has raised $3 million more from private investors. “That’s like $14 million in Silicon Valley,” Ms. Zimmerman said.</p>]
