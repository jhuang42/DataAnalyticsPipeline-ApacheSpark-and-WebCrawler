Oil prices fell soon after the tweet, with Brent crude posting its biggest intraday drop in weeks.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="716">But why has President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest bête noire?

So far, that strategy has worked:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="1203">With oil above $73 now, even after Mr. Trump’s tweet, fuel prices are at reaching two-year highs as the U.S. gets into the summer driving season.
