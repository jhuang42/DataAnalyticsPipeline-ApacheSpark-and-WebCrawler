Last year, it produced enough electricity for 1.8 million homes.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">CRACKS</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">In 2015, EDF Energy said routine inspections had revealed cracks in part of the graphite core at a Hunterston B nuclear reactor. It said three of 6,000 bricks had cracked, something that had been expected to begin happening at that point in the power station's life.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Two of EDF Energy's nuclear power plants in Britain - Heysham 1 and Hartlepool - were offline for months in 2014 for inspections after a crack was found on a boiler spine at Heysham 1.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">In Belgium, the regulator ordered production to be stopped at two nuclear reactors in 2012 after finding indications of tiny cracks in core tanks.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The cracks turned out to be particles of hydrogen that were trapped inside the tanks when they were made by a Dutch company in the early 1980s.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">EDF said it expects Hunterston B's Reactor 3 to return to service "before the end of 2018". EDF Energy's outage website shows an expected return date of Oct. 4. </p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Its Reactor 3 and Reactor 4 are both Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors. The outage will reduce its 2018 output by 3 terawatt hours, the company said.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">EDF Energy said the operation of its other UK reactors was not affected.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"> (Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter)</p>,>Advertisement</p>,class="css-12lb1tb"></p>,class="css-1ft1ynw"></p>,class="css-whjxzo"></p>,class="css-13sbuc">Collapse</p>,class="css-hlo4bz">SEE MY OPTIONS</p>]
