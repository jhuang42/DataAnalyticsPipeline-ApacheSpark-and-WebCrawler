More than 40 years ago, United States forces left this massive base where Marines landed, F-4C jets loaded up for bombing raids, and wounded American soldiers were treated.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="365">Now, some Vietnamese say they are yearning for the American military to return.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="705">“On Facebook, there was a question recently: What do you want from President Obama’s visit?” said Vo Van Tao, 63, who fought as a young North Vietnamese infantry soldier against the United States. “Some people said they wanted democracy. I said I wanted the Americans to come back to Cam Ranh Bay. A lot of people agreed with me.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="409" data-total-count="1114">Mr. Obama is scheduled to arrive in Vietnam on Sunday, the third visit by an American president since the war ended. The big question he is expected to answer is whether Washington will lift a partial arms embargo and allow Vietnam to buy lethal weapons from the United States. The Communist government has long asked for the ban to be revoked, and American access to Cam Ranh Bay could be part of the payoff.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="1368">For the White House, the decision on lifting the embargo has come down to a debate over trying to improve Vietnam’s poor human rights record versus enabling Vietnam to better defend itself against an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/world/asia/south-china-sea-militarization.html">increasing threat from China in the South China Sea</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="401" data-total-count="1769" id="story-continues-1">Washington has for years made lifting the ban contingent on Vietnam’s improving human rights for its people, and has prodded Vietnam to allow more freedom of speech and to release political prisoners. But as tensions with China have escalated in the South China Sea, the sentiment in the Obama administration has shifted toward lifting the ban, American officials familiar with the discussions said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="176" data-total-count="1945" id="story-continues-3">Vietnam’s government, pressed by an ever more powerful China, knows it cannot stand up to Beijing alone and is cautiously moving toward increased ties with the United States.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="322" data-total-count="2267">Despite their shared Communist ideology, Vietnam and China fought over islands in the South China Sea in the 1970s and ’80s. Two years ago, China sent an oil rig into disputed waters close to the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both countries, leading to clashes at sea and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/world/asia/anti-chinese-violence-turns-deadly-and-spreads-in-vietnam.html">anti-Chinese riots</a> in Vietnamese cities.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="2403">More recently, China has built artificial islands with military runways in the South China Sea just 300 miles from the Vietnamese coast.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="2664">Vietnam’s needs dovetail with those of the United States, which has been encouraging maritime states in Southeast Asia to better defend themselves, an effort partly aimed at keeping the United States from being dragged into a direct naval conflict with China.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="2810">The prospect of access to Cam Ranh Bay, where the Vietnamese have built a new international port, provides another enticement for lifting the ban.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="202" data-total-count="3012">An American presence there would allow United States forces to use the port on the western edge of the South China Sea, complementing American facilities <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/world/asia/philippines-south-china-sea-ash-carter.html"> in the Philippines</a> on the sea’s eastern edge.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="381" data-total-count="3393">“If the United States can get regular access to Cam Ranh Bay, it would be very advantageous to maintaining the balance of power with China,” said Alexander L. Vuving, a Vietnam specialist at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. “If something happens in the South China Sea, it takes a while for the U.S. to get there. China can get there more quickly.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="3676" id="story-continues-4">The Vietnamese, who shun alliances and forbid foreign bases, have made clear they would not entertain exclusive use of the facilities by the United States but would allow it to share the base with others.

That’s the negative from our point of view. But the positive is it starts a new era with the United States.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="89" data-total-count="6016">Lifting the embargo is not expected to produce a windfall for American defense suppliers.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="6368">Since Washington <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/asia/us-eases-embargo-on-arms-to-vietnam.html">partly lifted the embargo in 2014</a>, allowing the purchase of nonlethal equipment for maritime defense, Vietnam has not acquired any American equipment, not even coastal radar systems for its Coast Guard, said Carl Thayer, a defense analyst in Canberra, Australia, who specializes in Vietnam.
