As the universe expands and evolves during the Big Bang, the Higgs field, of which the boson is an expression, undergoes phase transitions, like water turning to ice. At some point, it gets stuck.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="272" data-total-count="8875">“What fixes the value of the Higgs is the history of the universe,” he said.
