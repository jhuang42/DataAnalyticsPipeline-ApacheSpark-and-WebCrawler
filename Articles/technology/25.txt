They were unassailable.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="4190">A Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="4413">“We had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential,” he said. “Could we buy RCA or NBC?

Besides Mr. Immelt’s outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out “bad actors” in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump’s proposed immigration restrictions in January.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="6288">Still, Mr. Immelt’s exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R.

Mr. George is much more optimistic than Mr. Sharer on whether chief executives will continue to speak out on broader issues, but he doesn’t expect Mr. Flannery to emulate his predecessor’s high profile.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="132" data-total-count="6984">“I don’t see him stepping into that role,” Mr. George said. “He’s going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="7298">At Exxon Mobil, it’s referred to as the God Pod.

Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="8361">The abundant perks — in G.E.’s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters — fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="8685">With G.E.’s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="8893">“Nothing was off-the-shelf,” said Bill O’Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. “With Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="9257" id="story-continues-7">Almost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="9614">One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken’s junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy’s to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="9985">By early this year, Mr. Peltz’s Trian Fund was pressing G.E. for deeper cost cuts, and to link <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/executive_pay/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about executive pay.">executive pay</a> more closely to lower expenses and higher profits. In March, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-23/peltz-immelt-showdown-heats-up-as-ge-rushes-to-bolster-profits">Bloomberg warned</a> of “a do-or-die showdown” between Mr. Peltz and Mr. Immelt, while <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2017/03/10/general-electric-ceo-immelt-in-hot-seat-with-trians-peltz.html">Fox Business reported</a> that Mr. Immelt was in the “hot seat” and could be forced to retire ahead of schedule.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="10166">G.E.’s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt’s decision to retire. “Sixteen years is a long time,” she said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="10384">But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="330" data-total-count="10714">“C.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that,” said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Without this outside pressure, it’s likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="11002">Now other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. “She’s being pulled in different directions,” Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.’s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="11144">If Ms. Barra can’t turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="11308">Indeed, Mr. Fields’s defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt’s slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="11563" id="story-continues-8">“He’s the poster child for what’s happened to the C.E.O. job,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “Until last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I’m sorry Ford forgot that recipe.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="85" data-total-count="11679">How did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="12025">For starters, even as the activists’ assets have grown, the number of public companies has shrunk drastically, said Matthew Slaughter, dean of Dartmouth’s Tuck School. From 1997 to 2015, the number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the old American Stock Exchange dropped by half, <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w22857.pdf">falling to 3,766 from 7,507</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="12182">“With fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,” Mr. Slaughter said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="12519">At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They’re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="12802">What’s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&amp;, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="12941">“You don’t have the C.E.O. running the board too,” said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&amp;. “Now the C.E.O. has a boss.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="13132">Boards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="13392">“There was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize,” he said. “The positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="13577" id="story-continues-9">So while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.’s, even if they fail, they’ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="13776">The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="13984">Google’s Class B shares have 10 times the voting power of normal shares, enabling the founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/6/13/15788892/alphabet-shareholder-proposals-fair-shares-counted-equally-no-supervote">retain control</a> of the holding company Alphabet without owning a majority stake.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="14189">Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="14475">“This is not a traditional governance model, but Facebook was not built to be a traditional company,” <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/04/q1-earnings-note/">the company said last year</a>. “The board believes that a founder-led approach has been and continues to be in the best interests of Facebook, its stockholders and the community.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="14626">The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="14799">In 1990, the revenues of Detroit’s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="15006">Silicon Valley’s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation — $247 billion — but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="15236" id="story-continues-10">That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, “If your stock is doing well, your job is safe.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="15573">If the old quarters for G.E.’s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.’s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="15887">They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="16223">“It has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together,” said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. “The Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It’s a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="16362">Perhaps, but like the fallen statue of Ozymandias in Shelley’s <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/46565">poem</a>, the old monuments to corporate power did possess a certain grandeur.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="16566">G.E.’s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J.
