That missed targets of some analysts including Deutsche Bank, although it topped the Factset consensus of $656 million.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The Santa Clara, California company for the first time disclosed that it made $289 million in sales - about 9 percent of its overall $3.2 billion in revenue - from chips for mining cryptocurrencies.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Analysts had expected $200 million and the greater reliance on the fast-growing but volatile business contributed to shares falling 1.4 percent to $256.40 in Friday trade. Nvidia shares have gained 33 percent this year, propelling the stock to the top of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. They touched a record high at $260.50 on Thursday before the announcement.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that the company expects cryptocurrency-related revenue to fall 65 percent to about $100 million in the next quarter. Retail prices for Nvidia's gaming chips surged earlier this year as miners snapped up chips, a development Nvidia addressed by releasing mining-specific chips.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"While supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing," Kress told investors on a conference call. "Gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter" were able to get their hands on new chips a reasonable price, she said.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Analyst Kevin Cassidy from Stifel said the reliance on cryptocurrency concerned some investors. Moreover, he said, Nvidia's earnings were mostly in line with expectations, "which may not be good enough for shares trading at 40x forward earnings."</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Data center industry sales have boomed as cloud services build out new facilities. Intel Corp last month said it had posted its biggest-ever quarterly jump in its data center business. For its part, Nvidia said it doubled sales of chips used by cloud companies for so-called deep learning.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy said he was not concerned by data center revenue because the buying patterns of huge cloud customers were "lumpy."</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Revenue from Nvidia's best-known business of gaming chips rose 68 percent to $1.72 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"At the core of it, gaming is strong," Chief Executive Jensen Huang told investors on the conference call. "The pent-up demand is quite significant and I'm expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon."</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">A cryptocurrency boom has powered growth at Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc, but the sector is battling volatility caused by swings in the currency's value.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Revenue from Nvidia's automotive business, which includes its Drive platform used in self-driving cars, rose 4 percent to $145 million, also topping analysts' estimate of $132 million.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Nvidia in March suspended self-driving tests across the globe, a week after an Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] autonomous vehicle struck and killed a 49-year-old woman crossing a street in Arizona. But CEO Huang remained optimistic.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"I expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019," Huang told investors.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The company's net income rose to $1.24 billion, or $1.98 per share, in the first quarter ended April 29, from $507 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Total revenue rose to $3.21 billion from $1.94 billion.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Excluding items, Nvidia earned $2.05 per share.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Analysts on average had expected revenue of $2.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"> (Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)</p>,>Advertisement</p>,class="css-12lb1tb"></p>,class="css-1ft1ynw"></p>,class="css-whjxzo"></p>,class="css-13sbuc">Collapse</p>,class="css-hlo4bz">SEE MY OPTIONS</p>]
