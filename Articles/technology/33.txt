Ms. Hamnett and the others had fielded many of the same demands from the American Chemistry Council and from Dr. Beck herself when she worked there. Ms. Hamnett took detailed notes in spiral notepads, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4113586-EPA-and-Toxic-Chemical-Rules.html#document/p334/a382963" title="Pages from Ms. Hamnett's notebooks">excerpts from which she showed</a> The Times.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="27116">One area of contention was Dr. Beck’s insistence that the E.P.A. adopt precise definitions of terms and phrases used in imposing rules and regulations, such as “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4113586-EPA-and-Toxic-Chemical-Rules.html#document/p304/a382960" title="American Chemistry Council recommends language, which EPA later inserts">best available science</a>” and “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4113586-EPA-and-Toxic-Chemical-Rules.html#document/p305/a382961" title="Weight of the evidence">weight of the evidence</a>.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="27280">The agency had repeatedly rejected the idea, most recently in January, in part because the definitions were seen as a guise for opponents to raise legal challenges.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="386" data-total-count="27666">“These terms have and will continue to evolve with changing scientific methods and innovation,” <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/17/2017-00051/procedures-for-prioritization-of-chemicals-for-risk-evaluation-under-the-toxic-substances-control">the agency said in a Jan. 17 statement</a> in the Federal Register, three days before Mr. Trump was sworn in. “Codifying specific definitions for these phrases in this rule may inhibit the flexibility and responsiveness of the agency to quickly adapt to and implement changing science.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="27999">Another area of dispute involved the “all uses” standard for evaluating health threats posed by chemicals. Under that standard, the E.P.A. would consider any possible use of a chemical when determining how to regulate it; Dr. Beck, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4113586-EPA-and-Toxic-Chemical-Rules.html#document/p294/a382959" title='Debate over "all uses"'>like the chemical industry</a>, wanted the E.P.A. to limit the evaluations to specific intended uses.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="28189">“There is no way we can look at thousands of uses,” Dr. Beck told Ms. Hamnett in one meeting in mid-May, according to Ms. Hamnett and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4113586-EPA-and-Toxic-Chemical-Rules.html#document/p294/a382959" title='Notes referring to "1000s" of uses, as Ms. Hamnett quotes Dr. Beck'>her notes</a>. “We can’t chase the last molecule.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="28402">As the June deadline under the new law approached, Dr. Beck took control of the rewriting herself, a highly unusual step at the E.P.A., where expert Civil Service employees traditionally hold the rule-writing pen.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="109" data-total-count="28511">Ms. Hamnett said she did not try to stop Dr. Beck given she had the support of the agency’s new leadership.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="28773" id="story-continues-17">Mr. Noe, the lawyer who worked with Dr. Beck during the Bush administration, was not involved in the rewriting of the new rules.

But Dr. Beck had demanded changes that the staff had rejected, meaning that the rule contained items that “differ so greatly from the proposal that they cannot be considered to be the ‘logical outgrowth’ of the proposal and the comments,” Ms. Celeste said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="30396">Her memo, sent by email on May 30 to Dr. Beck and more than two dozen agency scientists and staff members, also raised concerns about the preamble, an important piece of any regulation that must accurately reflect its contents.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="30600">“We are also concerned that, as currently drafted, the preamble lacks an adequate rationale for a number of final rule provisions that have changed significantly from the proposal,” Ms. Celeste wrote.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="452" data-total-count="31052" id="story-continues-18">The objections were strongly worded, but they fell short of an important legal threshold — the formal filing of a “nonconcurrence” memo — that would have triggered further review of Dr. Beck’s actions. Several E.P.A. staff members said in interviews that they had been told by Mr. Pruitt’s top deputies to air their concerns in so-called concur-with-comment memos, which put objections on the record but allowed the process to move forward.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="31258">The rules, with Dr. Beck’s changes, were sent to the White House and approved by the June deadline.

That would translate into a rigorous crackdown on the most dangerous chemicals, regardless of the changes.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="32044">But her confidence in the E.P.A.’s resolve was fragile, and it had been shaken by other actions, including the order Ms. Hamnett received to reverse course on banning the pesticide chlorpyrifos.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="32293">The order came before Dr. Beck’s arrival at the agency, but Ms. Hamnett saw the industry’s fingerprints all over it. Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, instructed Ms. Hamnett to ignore the recommendation of agency scientists, she said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="130" data-total-count="32423"><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4112113-EPA-Chlorpyrifos-FOIA-Emails-to-NYT.html#document/p1/a382356" title="Proposed ban">The scientists had called for a ban</a> based on research suggesting the pesticide might cause developmental disabilities in children.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="32570">To keep the pesticide on the market, under E.P.A. guidelines, the agency needed to have a “<a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/about-pesticide-registration">reasonable certainty</a>” that no harm was being caused.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="87" data-total-count="32657">“The science and the law tell us this is the way to go,” Ms. Hamnett said of a ban.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="32865">But the reaction from her superiors was not about the science or the law, she said. Instead, they queried her about Dow Chemical, the pesticide’s largest manufacturer, which had been <a href="http://www.chlorpyrifos.com/" title="Dow Chemical: Chlorpyrifos has been reliably used for more than 45 years">lobbying against a ban</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="142" data-total-count="33007">The clash is recorded in Ms. Hamnett notebook as well as in emails among Mr. Pruitt’s top political aides, which were obtained by The Times.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="33158">“They are trying to strong arm us,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4112113-EPA-Chlorpyrifos-FOIA-Emails-to-NYT.html#document/p24/a382354">Mr. Jackson wrote after meeting with Ms. Hamnett</a>, who presented him with a draft petition to ban the pesticide.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="33353">Mr. Jackson, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4112113-EPA-Chlorpyrifos-FOIA-Emails-to-NYT.html#document/p25/a382973" title="Pages from Ms. Hamnett's notebooks, related to the same meeting">Ms. Hamnett’s notebook shows</a>, then asked her to come up with alternatives to a ban.

But Dow, after Mr. Trump’s election, was suddenly in no mood to compromise, Ms. Hamnett recalled. Dow did not respond to requests for comment.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="120" data-total-count="33878">She now knew, she said, that the effort to ban the pesticide had been lost, something Mr. Jackson’s emails celebrated.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="33934">“They know where this is headed,” Mr. Jackson wrote.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="98" data-total-count="34032">Just over a week later, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4112113-EPA-Chlorpyrifos-FOIA-Emails-to-NYT.html#document/p32/a382351" title="Emails obtained via FOIA">Ms. Hamnett submitted a draft order</a> that would deny the request for a ban.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="34187">“It was hard, very hard,” she said, worrying that the pesticide would continue to harm children of farmworkers. “That was not one of my best days.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="34496">The episode is one reason she worries the E.P.A. will defer to the chemical industry as it begins to evaluate toxic chemicals under the standards created by the new law.
