Was that illegal? It may look bad, but it’s not illegal.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="2787" id="story-continues-4">Representative David B. McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, told Mr. Pruitt sympathetically that the attacks on him “have an echo of McCarthyism.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="3008">Representative Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, speaking in the morning session, drilled down on some of the ethics questions concerning Mr. Pruitt’s expenses in office and his past financial dealings.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="3205">She first asked about Mr. Pruitt’s famous soundproof booth, installed in his E.P.A. office at a cost of $43,000. The Government Accountability Office has ruled that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/climate/scott-pruitt-phone-booth.html">expenditure broke the law</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="3425">Mr. Pruitt had previously testified that the expense was appropriate. In light of the recent ruling, Ms. DeGette asked whether Mr. Pruitt knew that the purchase had violated the law and whether anyone would be penalized.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="52" data-total-count="3477">“We are investigating this internally,” he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="3617">“Would you agree that public officials should be held to the highest standards of ethical conduct?” she asked. He responded that he did.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="3703">Representative Tony Cárdenas, a California Democrat, also brought up the phone booth.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="152" data-total-count="3855">“I was not aware of the approval of the $43,000,” Mr. Pruitt told him, “and if I had known about it, congressman, I would not have approved it.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="103" data-total-count="3958">Mr. Cárdenas responded that “if someone was spending $43,000 in my office, I would know about it.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="4273">Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat, had scathing criticism for Mr. Pruitt when her turn for questioning came Thursday morning. “You have a solid record of violating ethics rules from the state level to the federal government,” she told him. “I think it’s an embarrassment.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="57" data-total-count="4330" id="story-continues-5">Then she asked: “Do you have any remorse? Yes or no?”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="129" data-total-count="4459">Mr. Pruitt responded: “I think there are changes I’ve made already. I’ve made a change from first class to coach travel.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="4632">Ms. Eshoo returned to her call for a yes-or-no answer, and asked Mr. Pruitt whether he would reimburse the government. He launched into a long response, but she cut him off.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="4753">“With all due respect, I may be elected, but I’m not a fool,” she said. “This is not ‘dodge-question’ day.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="430" data-total-count="5183">In the afternoon session, Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, pressed Mr. Pruitt about his claims that he had been obliged to fly first class because of “unprecedented” death threats. Ms. McCollum told Mr. Pruitt that her office had contacted the E.P.A. inspector general, Arthur A. Elkins Jr., and that “he disputed your claim.” Besides, she said, “We all receive death threats on our Facebook page.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="159" data-total-count="5362">Ms. DeGette also questioned Mr. Pruitt about his involvement in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/us/politics/scott-pruitt-oklahoma-epa.html">real estate deals in Oklahoma</a>, referring to the purchaser of his home as a “shell company.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="5508">“It’s not a shell company,” he said quickly, and said that such financial structures were commonly used to purchase real estate in Oklahoma.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="131" data-total-count="5639">She then asked Mr. Pruitt whether he had paid taxes on rent he received. He said such issues had been handed over to an accountant.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="408" data-total-count="6074">When asked in the morning session about his announcement this week that the E.P.A. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/climate/epa-science-transparency-pruitt.html">would restrict the kinds of scientific studies</a> that it would use in forming policy, Mr. Pruitt responded: “It seems to me that it’s common sense that as we do rule-making, we base it on scientific conclusions that we should be able to see the data and methodology that causes those conclusions. That makes sense to me.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="6310" id="story-continues-6">Ms. McCollum, the Minnesota Democrat, also took time to focus on the question of whether E.P.A. staff members who challenged Mr. Pruitt’s spending and other conduct had been unfairly demoted or reassigned.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="6503">Mr. Pruitt denied that any of his employees had been demoted, fired or sidelined because they had questioned his spending. “I’m not aware of any instance in that regard,” Mr. Pruitt said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="6819">Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, a Democrat, said in the afternoon session that she wanted to focus on “severe policy disagreements” with Mr. Pruitt and expressed concern that Trump administration officials appeared to believe they are “there to dismantle” the agencies they lead.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="396" data-total-count="7215">In his exchange with Ms. Pingree, the E.P.A. chief defended the administration’s efforts to repeal the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama’s signature plan to curb greenhouse gases. To support his position, he falsely said that the plan had been struck down by the Supreme Court. (The justices delayed the plan but did not rule on the merits before the change in administrations.)</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="203" data-total-count="7442">Mr. Pruitt said Thursday morning that the agency was “not at present” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/climate/trump-california-emissions.html">planning any efforts to revoke a decades-old waiver</a> that allows California to enforce its own emissions standards on automobiles.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="7789">But he would not say definitively whether that was a final position. The E.P.A. is “working very diligently and diplomatically with California to find answers on this issue,” Mr. Pruitt said, in response to questions from Representative Doris Matsui, a California Democrat who has sought to protect her state’s ability to regulate emissions.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="8091">Moments after Mr. Pruitt finished his second and final appearance of the day on Capitol Hill, his security detail hustled him out of the hearing room. Most Republicans also rushed out, while Democrats lingered to continue their criticisms of the administrator for reporters.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="8295">Representative Ken Calvert, the California Republican who presided over the afternoon session, called Mr. Pruitt’s appearance “very professional.” Asked whether Mr. Pruitt should resign, he said no.</p>]
