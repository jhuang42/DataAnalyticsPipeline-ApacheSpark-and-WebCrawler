The stock has dropped about 35 percent this year.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">"Our recent increase in marketing is beginning to have a positive impact on sell-through," Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Nicholas Woodman said on the call.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The company kept a tight leash on costs even as it pushed harder on advertising. Total operating expenses fell nearly 24 percent to $119.7 million.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">GoPro had said in January that it would be willing to partner with a larger sector player, but that it was not actively engaged in a sale.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">It launched a cheaper HERO in March and announced a "trade-up" program in April where users can exchange an older GoPro or any other digital camera and get discounts on the HERO6 or Fusion.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese believes the results of these programs are likely to show up in the second quarter. "It appears that GoPro didn’t have to discount as heavily in Q1 as in Q4 to reach its target revenue."</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The company forecast current-quarter revenue between $260 million and $280 million, above analysts' average estimate of $239.69 million. </p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">The net loss narrowed to $76.3 million in the quarter ended March 31 from $111.2 million a year earlier.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Excluding items, the company lost 34 cents per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of a loss of 37 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0">Revenue fell 7.4 percent to $202.35 million. Analysts had expected revenue of $184.2 million.</p>,class="css-1cy1v93 e2kc3sl0"> (Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka and Anirban Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Bernard Orr)</p>,>Advertisement</p>,class="css-12lb1tb"></p>,class="css-1ft1ynw"></p>,class="css-whjxzo"></p>,class="css-13sbuc">Collapse</p>,class="css-hlo4bz">SEE MY OPTIONS</p>]
