Solomon</a> for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-goldman-sachs-growth/goldman-details-5-billion-revenue-growth-plan-amid-investor-questions-idUSKCN1BN1LG">like lending to corporations and consumers</a>.

But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="3780">Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/goldman-quarterly-profit-flat-but-beats-estimates/">loath to talk</a> in detail when it underperforms.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="4091">Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/goldman-sachs-changes-ficc-leadership-structure-amid-struggles">on hedge fund clients</a>, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/goldman-in-testy-exchange-at-senate-panel-over-its-role-in-commodities-market/">in the face of political pressure</a>, has been a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/goldman-s-commodity-revenue-said-to-drop-75-to-lowest-on-record">drawn out disappointment</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="476" data-total-count="4567">And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/business/dealbook/whistleblower-supreme-court-sec.html">that would liquidate</a> a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="4731">Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="5223" id="story-continues-4">Goldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="5238"><em>— Peter Eavis</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="52" data-total-count="5313">David M.

Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows.
