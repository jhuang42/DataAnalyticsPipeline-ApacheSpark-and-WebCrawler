Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="1081" id="story-continues-1">Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="1305" id="story-continues-3">Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we’ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="1631">Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company’s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won’t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="1935">Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="399" data-total-count="2334">Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla’s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla’s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="2494">Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap’s initial public offering.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="612" data-total-count="3106">But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="85" data-total-count="3191">And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="3206"><em>— Peter Eavis</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="11" data-total-count="3271">The reason?</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="67" data-total-count="3338" id="story-continues-4">Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="3397"><a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-regulation-amazon-facebook-646c642c-a2d7-454b-a9a9-cdc6e4eaef2c.html?utm_source=sidebar">Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported</a>:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="3552">Mr. Swan added:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="4102">Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-stocks/amazon-sheds-53-billion-in-market-value-after-report-on-trump-threat-idUSKBN1H42HG"> a White House official told Reuters</a> there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment.
