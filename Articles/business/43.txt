For one company, Nim’s Fruit Crisps, the impact is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="264" data-total-count="513">Nim’s dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="753">The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain’s decision to leave the European Union — widely known as Brexit — the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="965">Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company’s founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. “I had to cut costs somewhere,” she said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="1006" id="story-continues-2">She could be speaking for all of Britain.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="1277">In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies’ paring their investments in Britain.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="392" data-total-count="1669">Last week, the picture appeared to brighten, as official data showed the economy had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/10/25/business/25reuters-britain-markets-gdp.html">expanded a tad more than expected</a> between July and September. The growth of 0.4 percent for the quarter, which bested expectations of 0.3 percent, reinforced the market’s assumptions that the Bank of England will lift rates when it convenes on Thursday, using a presumably stronger economy as the impetus.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="1824" id="story-continues-4">But some economists fear such a move is premature given Britain’s fragile state. Many focused on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/10/26/business/26reuters-britain-economy-retail.html">plunging retail and car sales</a> as a harbinger of trouble.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="2139">The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped over the past year while consumer credit is rising — a combination that often ends badly.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="500" data-total-count="2639">The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="2839">With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="3062">“Clearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months,” said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. “There is a sense that companies have been postponing investment.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="3312" id="story-continues-6">Britain now stands as one of the world’s weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth.

Companies are certainly delaying investment. They are being very cautious.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="6512">Two years ago, Mr. Lloyd employed as many as 20 people.
