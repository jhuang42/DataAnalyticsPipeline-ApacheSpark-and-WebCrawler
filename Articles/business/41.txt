This resulted in “positive net benefits to the U.S. economy during the last two decades of the 20th century.” These low-wage workers simultaneously generated “a redistribution of wealth from low- to high-skilled native-born workers.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="2605">The frequent harshness of these trade-offs in real life is masked by the academic language of the report, which points out that native-born workers who are substitutes for immigrants “will experience negative wage effects” — in other words, lower wages.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="21" data-total-count="2626" id="story-continues-1">The report continues:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="113" data-total-count="3067">While acknowledging these conflicts, the academy comes down <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550">decisively on the pro-immigration side</a> of the debate:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="3823">The academy’s report provides ammunition to both sides in the contentious debate over whether immigrants raise state and local tax burdens for education, health care and other welfare benefits or whether those costs are more than compensated for through taxes paid by immigrants:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="203" data-total-count="4577">In its analysis, the liberal group <a href="http://americasvoice.org/press_releases/national-academy-sciences-study-confirms-immigrants-benefit-america/">America’s Voice</a> cited the academy’s statement almost verbatim. <a href="http://cis.org/NAS-Study-Workers-and-Taxpayers-Lose-Businesses-Benefit">The conservative Center for Immigration Studie</a>s, on the other hand, interpreted the data to mean that</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="5022" id="story-continues-3">This ideological schism has shaped the current presidential election as well as ongoing congressional debates.
