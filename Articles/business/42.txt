In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom’s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer.

But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes – and the latest <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/meeting-societys-expectations/solving-the-productivity-puzzle">big work</a> on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot’s Neil Irwin does a great job of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/upshot/the-economy-is-getting-hotter-is-a-productivity-boom-next.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FProductivity&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection">explaining</a> McKinsey’s main finding:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="7907">Little in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey’s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="8236" id="story-continues-5"><strong>1)</strong> In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="449" data-total-count="8685">In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="8929"><strong>2)</strong> If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries?</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="929" data-total-count="9858"><strong>First, the numbers:</strong> From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain’s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="9873"><em>— Peter Eavis</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="10367"><a href="https://blocnotesdeleco.banque-france.fr/en/blog-entry/are-monopolies-danger-united-states">New research</a> posted by France’s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production.
