Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years.

The jump in hourly earnings in January — which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier — was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February’s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="5318">Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday’s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="5489">The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="5678" id="story-continues-6">The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="6019">In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren’t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="6338">But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won’t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn’t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="6353"><em>— Peter Eavis</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="6463">It’s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="29" data-total-count="6492">Maybe we can shed some light.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="6823">As Friday’s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="7007"><strong>But how long might wage growth remain moderate?</strong> Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, suggests there is very little.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="463" data-total-count="7470">But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce – and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers — and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="7874">One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="131" data-total-count="8005" id="story-continues-7">But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="95" data-total-count="8100"><strong>How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate – and why did you make your tweaks?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="541" data-total-count="8641">Let me start with the “why?” The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should “count” as unemployed. But the problem is that it’s <em>too</em> broad. It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work, namely retirees. And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging. So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy, we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="441" data-total-count="9082">One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called “prime-age” workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="9430">My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, “What would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="9510"><strong>What does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="9814">By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it’s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="9915"><strong>Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="10105">Yes, but it doesn’t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="539" data-total-count="10644">Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons — technology, globalization, video games — the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="973" data-total-count="11617" id="story-continues-8">If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we’re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don’t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today’s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="11937">•<strong> Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer,</strong><em> BofA Merrill Lynch</em><strong>:</strong> Today’s “Goldilocks” report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go: the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand, preventing price pressures from building too aggressively.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="12232">•<strong> Ellen Zentner,</strong> <em>Morgan Stanley</em>: Straight lines don’t exist in economics.

The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. This will not be lost among an F.O.M.C. that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. How strong is this labor market? The increase of 806,000 in the labor force and 785,000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant, which is a rare two-for in the monthly labor report.
