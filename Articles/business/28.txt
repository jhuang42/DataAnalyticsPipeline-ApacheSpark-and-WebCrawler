But he would be impossible to imitate. He isn’t ribald. He’s droll. Sometimes he’s not even that. Sometimes he’s quiet. Sometimes he’s sitting across from you expecting you to hold up your end of a conversation. Sometimes he’s listening and hearing you — like, really hearing you. This is the Peele who made “Get Out,” and it takes a minute to square him with the Peele from “Key &amp; Peele.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="505" data-total-count="1037">On Halloween, we had lunch at one of those casually cool American bistros in Los Angeles where all the food seems as if it was grown out back. He chose a spot outside, not to be seen (although a few people saw him) but mostly to see. Peele, who is 38, lives in his head, and he watches the world around him intensely. I got the duck, then so did he, and while we ate I was pretty sure I could hear him thinking. It was toward the end of the meal when he saw someone he recognized. Well, he thought he did.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="803" data-total-count="1840">“He’s dressed like Chris,” he said with some amusement. “Do you think he’s being Chris?” He was looking past me, so it was hard to turn all the way around to confirm with any subtlety. But Peele’s gaze made it perfectly obvious to the person approaching that Peele was looking at him. “Are you Chris from ‘Get Out’ for Halloween?” Peele asked, committing less an act of racial profiling than an uncanny identification of his own handiwork. “Get Out,” of course, is the surprise hit movie that Peele wrote and directed about a black man named Chris, who discovers that his white girlfriend’s family is running a nasty racist conspiracy. Chris has big, watery eyes that seem red from weariness (or weed) and wears a collarless blue chambray shirt over a gray T-shirt and jeans.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="733" data-total-count="2573">The man Peele thought might be costumed as Chris was also black, with skin as dark and eyes as striking as those of Daniel Kaluuya, the actor who plays Chris. This impostor was indeed Chris-attired too. And the white woman he was with could also have been part of the costume. It was the sort of similarity that, once pointed out, can’t be unseen. Alas, it wasn’t Halloween for this guy, just Tuesday. He was thrilled, nonetheless, to be stopped by Chris’s inventor, and he asked Peele for a photo. Peele, who got a kick even out of being wrong, asked him for one, too. The impostor then offered an incidental, partial explanation for why “Get Out” became the phenomenon it did: No, he wasn’t Chris, “but I could be.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="2942" id="story-continues-2">It has been 10 months, and we’re still talking about this movie and its alarming presentation of white racism. “Get Out” opened at the top of the box office at the end of February and has grossed many, many times the $4.5 million it cost to make. Racism is old, but Peele found a poetic new way of talking about it. He gave us language we didn’t know we lacked.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="928" data-total-count="3870" id="story-continues-4">For a white audience, the movie might be one of the few times they’ve been asked to identify with a regular, imperiled black person without the sweetener of a white co-star — no Spencer Tracy or Sandra Bullock here, just Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford as the Armitages, the sort of parents who’ll inquire about the history of their daughter’s interracial relationship by asking: “How long’s this been going on? This <em>thang</em>,” as daddy Armitage does. For a black audience, the movie could have ended right there. What does an affluent, middle-aged, suburban white dude know about a thang? And what’s he doing saying the word with this much insinuating self-delight, this much put-on jive? “I didn’t want any white saviors,” Peele said over lunch. White saviors hog the history of race in American film. Instead, his movie is full of white people whom Peele reveals as insatiable predators of blackness.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="797" data-total-count="4667">In a bid to help rid Chris of the urge to smoke, Mrs. Armitage tries hypnosis. She sits him down and swirls a spoon around the rim of a teacup and commands him to “sink into the floor.” Suddenly, Chris can’t move. He’s entered a state of paralysis that Mrs. Armitage calls the “sunken place.” There’s a cut to Chris falling downward into a dark space, looking up at the lighted surface where his body sits motionless while his struggling subconscious drowns. It’s a strange, complicated, disturbing metaphor for the long history of white control over the black body. It’s also a prelude to the rest of the movie’s sinister doings, which include a racist cabal of the Armitages and their mostly white friends and culminate in an elaborate medical procedure called “coagula.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="628" data-total-count="5295" id="story-continues-5">The “sunken place” is the movie’s most potent metaphor. Peele says he devised it as a way of thinking about a crisis like the mass incarceration of black men. “The first moment in the writing process where I sat there and cried,” he told me, “was realizing that while I was having fun writing this mischievous popcorn film, there were real black people who were being abducted and put into dark holes, and the worst part of it is we don’t think about them. I hadn’t been thinking about them. We put them to the back of our minds. That was kind of a trigger point for me, this idea of the back of one’s mind.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="654" data-total-count="5949">As a concept, the sunken place has grown even more capacious. It has been repurposed to explain both institutional disenfranchisement and racial self-estrangement — an explanation for the behavior of black people who seem to be under white control, based on either their sustained proximity to whiteness or statements construable as anti-black, or probably both. Sunken-place entrants include Clarence Thomas, Ben Carson, Tiger Woods, O.J. Simpson, sometimes Kanye West and any black person with something nice to say about President Trump. It’s more generous than “sellout” and less punitive than “Uncle Tom,” a dis and a road to redemption.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1166" data-total-count="7115">Before he noticed fake Chris, Peele had been talking about the restricted ways bigotry is discussed. “We’re never going to fix this problem of racism if the idea is you have to be in a K.K.K. hood to be part of the problem,” he said. The culture still tends to think of American racism as a disease of the Confederacy rather than as a national pastime with particular regional traditions, like barbecue. “Get Out” is set in the Northeast, where the racial attitude veers toward self-congratulatory tolerance. Mr. Armitage, for instance, gets chummy with Chris by telling him he’d have voted for Obama a third time. “Get Out” would have made one kind of sense under a post-Obama Hillary Clinton administration, slapping at the smugness of American liberals still singing: “Ding dong, race is dead.” Peele shows that other, more backhanded forms of racism exist — the presumptuous “can I touch your hair” icebreaker, Mr. Armitage’s “I voted for Obama, so I can’t be racist” sleeper hold are just two. But Clinton lost. Now the movie seems to amplify the racism that emanates from the Trump White House and smolders around the country.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="763" data-total-count="7878">A few people have remarked to me, not unreasonably, that “Get Out” isn’t terribly plausible. The cabal doesn’t make sociological sense. How does the cotton stuffing go from the armchair into Chris’s ears? What does a weekend at the Armitages look like with no black visitor? None of the terror stands up to logic! But when is terror logical? Peele developed a tone, other than hysteria, to present the black experience of discomfort in seemingly benign white worlds and the way their residents chronically deny the reality of that experience. Peele takes that reality as a given, but he is amplifying the paranoia that results from its constant denial. It’s a movie made by a person having the same bad dream I and lots of other black people have had.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="8173">Every time I’ve seen it, I’ve thought about that moment not too far into Toni Morrison’s “Song of Solomon” when somebody asks, “What difference do it make if the thing you scared of is real or not?” What befalls the black characters in “Get Out” is the thing we’re scared of.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="714" data-total-count="8887"><strong>Before we met, </strong>Peele presented one serious stipulation. “When you come to the office and see cards with names and details on them, I don’t want anybody knowing about that,” he warned. He is already at work on his next movie and doesn’t want to say much about what it is. He does intend to sic the “Get Out” model on other phobias and -isms. But which ones? “It’s tippy-top secret,” he told me on Halloween. “I can give you hints or something.” Peele says he wants to make “more social thrillers about different human demons, and the first human demon that I was trying to tackle with ‘Get Out’ was racism and neglect for one another. It’s going to be another piece of that project.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="778" data-total-count="9665">On an overcast afternoon, Peele’s assistant, a chill young man named Alex Kim, drove us into the Hollywood Hills to the Spanish-style colonial house that for about eight months has been the office of Peele’s production company, Monkeypaw. Like a lot of the residences up here, this one is nestled into the geological table and seems charmingly underfurnished. Most of the common space feels spare in a lonely, college-y sort of way. Some rooms have rugs, but the longer you’re there, the more rugs you want to put down. There were no visible markers of any coming projects, just walls of inspired fan art and designer posters, like the black-and-white image of a coffee mug fashioned with Kaluuya’s worried face and a spoon stirring where the top of his skull should be.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="884" data-total-count="10549">These guys might be too busy to worry about décor. Peele is producing a new “Twilight Zone” for CBS All Access and, with Misha Green and J.J. Abrams, another anthology series for HBO based on the 2016 novel by Matt Ruff, “Lovecraft Country.” Peele’s comedy “The Last O.G.” — in which an ex-con played by Tracy Morgan adjusts to, among other things, Brooklyn gentrification — is set to start on TBS in the spring. Monkeypaw is co-producing Spike Lee’s next movie, “Black Klansman,” in which an undercover detective somehow winds up running a chapter of the K.K.K. And then there’s the diversification initiative for young writers and filmmakers working in what lots of fans and critics call “genre,” which combs the country for voices — women of color, say, or gay people — that Hollywood tends to ignore. And of course there’s Peele’s own movie.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="808" data-total-count="11357" id="story-continues-6">Wandering around the house makes clear that Peele’s lean into horror and thriller and science fiction and fantasy isn’t a lean at all. It’s just Peele. Anytime I’d marvel at a picture or poster in the house, he seemed delighted that I recognized it. He recited with perfect accuracy the scariness classifications from Stephen King’s 1981 horror-culture manifesto, “Danse Macabre” — terror, horror, revulsion — and convincingly applied them to “The Blair Witch Project.” He loves Alfred Hitchcock’s films (“every single possible aspect of the cinema working in unison to bring you something new”). But also Darren Aronofsky’s bonkers crypto-Old Testament flop, “Mother!”: “I think that that movie will stand the test of time in a way that more successful movies won’t.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="844" data-total-count="12201">Peele’s space on the top floor doubles as a mini museum of his sensibility. A tall, loaded bookshelf holds everything from screenwriting manuals and six installments of the Japanese manga landmark “Akira” to Raymond Carver’s “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” to an LP of Philip Glass’s score for the underrated 1992 urban-blight horror film “Candyman.” There are encyclopedias on “early earth” and “vampire, werewolves and other monsters,” and a slender volume titled “Trolls.” “Another one of my favorites over there,” Peele said, gesturing toward a frame hanging by the door: a poster for “The Secret of NIMH,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLE65PZ30tM">an animated Don Bluth feature film from 1982</a>. It’s “a weird combination of fantasy,” he said, “and kind of melancholy and some scary [expletive], but beautiful. Beautiful.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="928" data-total-count="13129">“I’m a film geek,” he told me when we first met. And as a film geek, Peele has learned the rules for various genres — whom they include, omit and exploit and how to re-engineer it all. Earlier, Peele thought aloud about the notorious horror convention of black characters being the first to die. He believes we’ve looked at it the wrong way. The real problem, as Peele sees it, is that they don’t survive the movie at all. “Final girl” is a horror trope. “Final brother” is not. Usually, if Peele is watching a black person in a horror movie, he knows that “it’s just a matter of time until Tyrone walks away to smoke some weed or pee or something and gets macheted. It used to come right at that moment when you know everyone’s going to die. But you definitely know the final girl is not going to be the black dude.” So Kaluuya represents a correction. Now, he said, “Daniel’s the final girl.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="855" data-total-count="13984">For a movie with this much grisliness centered around as fraught a theme as race relations in America, it’s notable that the only substantial fight about it has been one of classification: What is it? In mid-November, it was reported that “Get Out” had been submitted for Golden Globes consideration in the “musical or comedy” category, in which it’s now a nominee. Twitter — black Twitter — practically collapsed in exasperation, managing a collective SMDH. “Musical or comedy” constituted an insult, albeit an ironic one, to the historical injury the film appeared to be addressing. The dismay amounted to: What’s so funny about black pain? At the controversy’s peak, Peele tweeted simply, <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanpeele/status/930796561302540288">“It’s a documentary,”</a> poking the beehive with characteristic waggishness. But days later, he released a statement that read, in part:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="720" data-total-count="15240">Peele told me he meant for the tweet and the statement to reflect the anguish and pride of the movie’s fans. “To me one of the greatest things about having this movie come out is we can get to this conversation that says: Who’s calling it what, and why are they calling it that?” With that “documentary” tweet, Peele was more or less saying that the movie’s genre is truth. Its other genre could be empathy. A nonwhite audience might have been Chris once, twice or all the time. But white audiences are pushed into an uncomfortable new experience. “One of the reasons this movie clicked with more than just a black audience,” Peele said, “is because you get to be black while you’re watching it.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="550" data-total-count="15790"><strong>Blackness is</strong> <strong>the</strong> orienting principle of Peele’s art. Its richness, its strangeness, its beauty, its complication, its ridiculousness, its divisiveness, its allure, its very realness. Many a black artist has explored blackness, but few have found it as fascinating as Peele appears to. It perplexes, amuses and excites him, the way language obsesses some novelists and food delights certain cooks. Increasingly, though, he has wanted to do more <em>for</em> blackness — building that pipeline, for instance, through which other artists’ ideas would flow.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="16071">You can see the shift from frolic to duty in his sketch work with Keegan-Michael Key. Their Comedy Central show, “Key &amp; Peele,” was, in some ways, a lab for “Get Out,” one in which they did as much critiquing of blackness as they did of white people’s relationship to it.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="877" data-total-count="16948">One sketch from Season 1 features a fake documentary about the <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/r74rp2/key-and-peele-gefilta-fresh-and-dr--dreidel">bar mitzvah “party motivators”</a> Gafilta Fresh (Key) and Dr. Dreidel (Peele). They blast into a banquet hall with a dose of rappity-rap B-boy blackness. They’re Kid ’N Play. They’re a minstrel act. And everybody digs them. The documentary cuts to a Jewish mother who says: “When you see black people at a bar mitzvah, it’s very exciting. It’s like a scary ride. And the kids just love it.” The father tells the filmmakers: “You just really can’t put a price on the look on your child’s face when they see a black person for the first time. It’s just magical.” Gafilta and Dreidel do all kinds of stereotypical black-party shtick, in the hope, they say, of exposing Jewish kids to black people early enough so that they don’t discriminate. It’s a walk around the rim of a sunken place.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="769" data-total-count="17717">Somewhere in all this code-switching and impersonation is a stinging indictment of the cultural attraction to “niggas.” America loves a loud, crazy, funny black person as much as it needs to see him passed over for work, harshly sentenced and shot to death. “Key &amp; Peele” was unusually creative in the way it satirized that duality, until the gravity of what we were being asked to laugh at began to darken the lunacy of the show. For the final two seasons, the bright “Cosby Show”-style a cappella number that opened each episode was replaced with ominous “True Detective”-like music, and rather than talking to a live audience, the comedians talked to each other in a car. They were on a road trip, but their enclosure whispered “fallout shelter.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="593" data-total-count="18310">Key and Peele’s was a classical comedy combo: tall and shorter, zany and chill, wet and dry, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Key’s exuberant virtuosity can upstage Peele’s subtlety. Peele is quieter and seems to be doing less. Whether Key is Michael Jackson or Tim Cook, he boils over, melts down, blows up, simmers, stews and karate-kicks. He’s the rocket. Peele is the control center. He doesn’t appear to hunger for applause the way Key does. You laugh at Key because he works so hard. You laugh at Peele because, by comparison, he makes it look easy.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="468" data-total-count="18778" id="story-continues-7">Key told me he believes “Get Out” is cathartic for Peele. He’s using his work to work on himself. “I’m the kind of person who would sit across from a therapist on the couch and go, ‘Then my mom. ...’ ” Key told me. “Whereas Jordan doesn’t know another way to do it other than to <em>do</em>, and he has enough confidence in himself to say, ‘Well, I’m going to do it this way,’ and I’m not sure he’s necessarily conscious that he’s doing it.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1012" data-total-count="19790">Peele suspects that the self-investigation he is undertaking through his work has something to do with his father, whom he didn’t see after his 7th or 8th birthday. He contrasts his relationship to his blackness with that of Key, whose biological and adoptive fathers were black. “If you had a black father around, I think that role model gave him a context to understand his blackness,” he says. “I would probably have been the voice in ‘Key &amp; Peele’ that was pushing and pushing and pushing to expand the definition of ‘African-American.’ I can see how that is something I’ve been searching for in my art.” He and Key played scores of black people of every type, and many with no type at all. For some African-Americans, for a long time, rules for what counts as black have been apparent. And they’ve been fixed. The joy of Peele’s comedy with Key was in their violation of those rules. The show was about how lost in this stuff we all are. “Get Out” is a determination to be found.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="591" data-total-count="20381">In November, Peele was in good spirits as he sat in the greenroom before a conversation with Seth Meyers at the 92nd Street Y. He was dressed in new jeans, white sneakers and a black sweater with a taxi-cab-yellow stripe across the front. It was a variation on his usual streetwear (baseball caps, varsity jackets, hoodies, boots) but even fresher. As he was getting ready to go onstage, I asked him if he missed performing. His answer was firm. “I don’t miss it. I just don’t.” Did he not miss it for the moment? Like, was he on a break from it? Or did he existentially not miss it?</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="20710">“I existentially don’t miss it,” he said. “I think there will probably be a point where I get really excited about a role and go for it because it feels fresh again and new.” With comedy, “the failure on performing is brutal,” he said, then laughed to himself. “We’ll see how I feel when my next movie bombs.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1164" data-total-count="21874">I mentioned that the between-sketch banter in the early episodes of “Key &amp; Peele” was often as funny and as revealing as the sketches themselves. “One of the hardest things about a sketch show is,” he started to say, before taking a second to consider what the hardest thing could be. He happened to be facing the dressing-room mirror, giving himself a solemn stare. “The way we were approaching sketch was complete immersion into these characters and going for it. People like routine in television. They like ritual. They like knowing what they’re going to get. This is why it’s hard to break in a new sketch show — because the first season you just look like a bunch of people putting on outfits and trying too hard to make everybody laugh. And we only want to laugh at people we trust, not these new [expletive] coming in. No way.” He thought some more. “I’ve noticed that the truth works. People can feel the truth. If you’re being yourself and you’re just using your own emotions, they can feel it. If you’re doing fake, they can feel it. It took me a while in comedy to realize that your truth is more powerful than your mask.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="556" data-total-count="22430" id="story-continues-10"><strong>Peele grew up</strong> on the fifth floor of a brownstone walk-up a block and a half from Central Park, a paradise that some of my black friends still don’t feel is theirs. But as a teenager, Peele used it to clear his head or explore his thoughts, the rainier and gloomier the better. He wasn’t a morose kid, he said, just introspective. “I don’t know, there was always something about the rain that was like I couldn’t be upset,” he said. “It was just always instant happiness, instant connection to something, and some sort of connection to God.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1138" data-total-count="23568">Through eighth grade, Peele went to local public schools. Then he attended the Calhoun School, about a 20-minute walk from his apartment. He was a nerd, a black nerd, before black nerds were a thing, before there were “blerds” (a word he and Key both casually use). They were nerds in the time of Lamar from the “Revenge of the Nerds” movies and Steve Urkel from “Family Matters” and, in a different way, Carlton Banks from “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.” If you reminded anyone of them, you were dead. But he never got hassled in the cafeteria or between classes. In seventh grade, Peele had a bunch of Garfield shirts he liked to wear. There’s nowhere to hide for a black kid in a Garfield shirt. “I never tried to wear the clothing to not get me beat up,” he said. “I was into musical theater, I was into movies, I was into being free. I was a child, and I’m still that child. Part of being a child internally is not falling victim to fashion, not feeling like you have to present something that you’re not.” He was charming and funny and had some close friends, two of whom now work with him at Monkeypaw.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="803" data-total-count="24371">Growing up, Peele came to love “Rosemary’s Baby” — he lived a few blocks from the Dakota, the mega manse in the movie. Tim Burton’s “Edward Scissorhands” was another personal landmark. He has a warm memory of his mother’s taking him to see it at the Ziegfeld Theater, the single-screen palace that projected its final film last year. “The movie just crushed me,” he said. “I thought it was, you know, the best movie I had seen, and still, any day, it could debatably be my No. 1.” Burton’s persecuted misfit artisan spoke to him. So did Burton, one of Peele’s favorite directors, whose approach to filmmaking revolves around the experience of belonging: “I feel like I don’t quite fit in, like how I am supposed to fit in,” he said, summing up one of Burton’s themes.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="837" data-total-count="25208" id="story-continues-11">Peele’s father, Hayward Peele, wasn’t around much and had other children with other women in different parts of the country. Peele has fond memories of him and of the limited time they spent together. And yet he remains curious about a major part of himself that stood out in the context of his mother’s white extended family. When I spoke to Peele’s mother, Lucinda Williams, on the phone, stories from her life and life with her son poured out. She tried to keep Peele’s father connected to their son, first through visits, but she learned not to count on those after he stood Peele up a few times. Then she tried to keep the culture of him around — the jazz and food that he liked. But some things she wouldn’t have, like the time he asked Peele why he “talked white.” “I knew I couldn’t allow that,” she said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="820" data-total-count="26028">Peele said he was never made to feel different. He was loved. But the void he felt was out of his mother’s control. It was out of his too. He knows that in some ways he’s searching for something through his work that he may never sufficiently resolve in his life. When Peele was an adult, a half brother reached out to him through social media and shared details about his father’s life after he left them, but this only compounded the questions. In July, Peele became a father himself, and he wants, as best he can, to protect his son from these nagging mysteries of the self. Perhaps his adolescent plunge into the worlds of fantasy and sci-fi and horror was a respite from the question “<em>Who am I?</em>” But in adulthood, he’s using genre as an instrument of self-discovery and social X-ray: <em>This is who we are</em>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="618" data-total-count="26646">Peele talked about his childhood over two tiny <em>croque-monsieurs</em> and a couple of mimosas at a busy French place less than a quarter mile from the apartment he grew up in. Maybe bringing all this up saddened him, but it didn’t show. He even laughed through some of it. Peele curses a lot, and he’s fond of using “man” as an interjection. There’s an enthusiastic crack of adolescence, of nasality, in his voice that might sound nerdy but is also warm. Ascribing whiteness to it might say more about the ascriber than about Peele. It permits you to miss what the voice is saying. He sounds perfectly black to me.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="981" data-total-count="27627">Peele is married to Chelsea Peretti, the wry, sneakily blunt observational comedian. While we walked around the Upper West Side, he told me that the acidity and audacity of her humor struck him. He looked up some videos of her and watched a web series she made. “Oh! You know what?” he said, interrupting his train of thought. “The first time I fell in love with her was this ‘Comedy Bang! Bang!’ episode.” The guests on the podcast included Peretti and some of her fellow writers on “Parks and Recreation.” “They were pretending to be sort of bad, obnoxious comedians, and it was really subversive and subtle, and I said to my assistant, ‘Who is that?’ He was like, ‘That’s Chelsea Peretti,’ and I said to him right there — no joke — ‘There’s a 10 percent chance I will marry that woman right over there, because she is cracking my [expletive] up.’ ” Naturally, he reached out to her on Twitter. “I slid up in them DMs,” he clarified.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="701" data-total-count="28328">Peretti is white and, in certain moviegoers’ analysis, the presumed subject of “Get Out.” People who don’t know her or Peele want to know what the deal is. They both say there isn’t one. But Peretti understands the confusion. “I can’t really fault anyone for wondering what it’s about,” Peretti told me over the phone. “I don’t even know if either of us fully knows. Some of it is like poetry — it’s not all fully intellectual and logical.” She went on: “All of art has some stuff that’s real and some stuff that’s not, but I can’t really distinguish for him, for his movie, what was what. I certainly don’t harvest black bodies for my eternal liberty ... yet.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="758" data-total-count="29086">Peele didn’t mean for Chris and his girlfriend, Rose, to function as avatars of his marriage. He was thinking more universally. “I can’t point to somebody who I’ve felt betrayed by on a racial level,” he told me one evening. “I wrote it before I met Chelsea. This is why you marry a comedian: because she gets it,” he said. “I knew that something would ring true about the narrative of the white family and the white woman and the trap that that can be for a black man.” He has never felt trapped by the Perettis. He wanted to challenge Hollywood’s idealization of interracial relationships. They’re a fact of American life and yet also still suspicious, even to enlightened people, even to people in an actual interracial relationship.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1010" data-total-count="30096">“It’s still a principle that’s disapproved of from both sides,” Peele said. “Part of me thought: I don’t know if people will want to come and see an interracial love story, even put in this sort of horror setting, because there’s something about it that makes people uncomfortable. At the same time, there’s a conventional way we’re meant to deal with miscegenation in pop culture, which is with a certain reverence. It’s Romeo and Juliet. It’s Martin Luther King’s dream.” Peele jaundices the romance. Rose is no Juliet: She’s a bloodthirsty vacuumer of black souls. But the movie isn’t only about black men and the white women they date. It’s entirely possible the movie is about something else. About the terror of black America accusing you of “talking white.” About feeling suspicious as a black person among white people. Maybe they’re guilty of, say, coveting you, and maybe the covetousness is all your fault, a result of having gotten so close in the first place.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1348" data-total-count="31444"><strong>In an out-of-the-way</strong> spot on the first floor of the Monkeypaw office hangs one of the only “Key &amp; Peele” references in the house. It’s an image from a Season 3 sketch called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st21dIMaGMs">“Continental Breakfast.”</a> It stars Peele, in a black toupee and thin mustache, as a rootin’-tootin’ businessman who is informed that his stay at a Comfort Inn-type hotel includes a continental breakfast. “It’s ... <em>continental</em>?” he asks, before he saunters up to the thingy that dumps Froot Loops into a plastic-foam bowl and renames the bewildered Latino busboy “<em>garçon</em>.” At first, the joke appears to be about the corporate sham of fancifying such shabbiness. Then it appears to be about the kind of black small-timer who takes “continental” at its word and permits inexperience to recast the business-travel buffet spread as the apotheosis of upper crustiness. (“Paper and everything,” he says, marveling at one of those tiny, oily muffins.) But when Peele sits down and begins to sample his selection, his nincompoopery blossoms into musicality. Each item receives a serenade of ignorant delight. (“Baked to perfection,” he sings after he chomps into an unpeeled banana.) He doesn’t eat so much as conduct an orchestra of gluttony (Strauss provides the musical soundtrack). His elation segues first into orgasm, then into blubbering.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="383" data-total-count="31827" id="story-continues-12">I always laugh so hard at this sketch that I lose the joke. Peele is that absurdly moving. He gave dozens of tremendous, tremendously original performances. This one happens to be my favorite. The comedy comes from a place of intense passion and utter abandon. The man is a fool. But Peele insists that anyone who can love even this food this deeply deserves more than your laughter.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1088" data-total-count="32915">The image that hangs in Peele’s office comes from the sketch’s punch line: It’s a black-and-white photograph of the businessman character beaming at a banquet-hall table, the one black face in an ocean of well-heeled, blank-looking white ones. “Continental Breakfast Buffet 1935,” it reads. The dateline could also be: “Sunken Place, forever.” The sketch was part of that season’s Halloween episode (the last shot alludes to the last shot of Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining”). A close-up of that photo is also Peele’s Twitter avatar. It’s an embrace of his comedic brilliance that also feels like a reminder: <em>Stay woke</em>. Maybe that fear of alienation fostered his fascination with blackness and fueled his determination not to lose touch with or forsake it, no matter how many white best friends and girlfriends and co-writers and producers he has had. I’ve been there. Lots of black people have been there. “Get Out” is a hit because Jordan Peele is not alone. It’s a hit because, not so secretly, it’s about a profound fear of being black and isolated.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1118" data-total-count="34033">In the movie, Chris’s best friend is a T.S.A. agent named Rod Williams, who is played by the stand-up Lil Rel Howery. Rod’s skepticism is a surrogate for the audience’s. His sarcasm is more than comic relief; it’s black people talking back to the screen. Howery delivers all the easy laughs. But when the Armitage cabal snares Chris, it’s Rod to the rescue. Comedy saves Chris from horror. But Rod feels far more crucial than that. It’s important that Chris’s best friend is a more down, average black person. It’s important that Rod works for the T.S.A., a para-law-enforcement outfit that screens for safety, often staffed, depending on your city, almost entirely by black people. It’s this guy who comes to save Chris from all this whiteness. They might not be friends in the real world. But in the metaphor, the relationship makes sense. Who else would have realized that two and two equals “coagula”? Who else could get Chris out of the sunken place but a man who refuses to be sunk? Rod is justice of a sort and unconditional support. He’s the movie’s secret weapon and moral SEAL team.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="34379">It’s the big surprise of “Get Out.” Peele made a nightmare about white evil that doubles as a fairy tale about black unity, black love, black rescue. More than once, Peele said he made this movie for a black audience. More than once, he mentioned how gratifying the black embrace has been for him: “No award will ever equal that to me.”<span class="tombstone"><i class="icon"></i></span></p>]
