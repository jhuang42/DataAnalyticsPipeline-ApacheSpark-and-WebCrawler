While the company ultimately plans to expand into an array of businesses, its initial focus is on hydroponic farming, using software and sensors to monitor growing conditions. (Its first farm is on Lanai, the Hawaiian island of which Mr. Ellison <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-04-13/four-seasons-manele-bay-lanai-hawaii">owns roughly 98 percent</a>.)</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="1700">Sensei’s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="2014">“So far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot.

This is where Sensei is focused.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="2218">Its first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food.

Facebook is still facing questions about Russia-linked accounts that had significant reach within the United States through the social network. In both cases, Facebook has struggled to show the public that it can get in front of its problems. Information about the Russia-linked accounts <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/11/01/facebook-says-146-million-americans-targeted-russia-campaign/821306001/">came out piecemeal</a>, and Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/">knew as early as 2015</a> that the political data firm had violated its data policies.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="6064">Mr. Zuckerberg at first <a href="https://www.recode.net/2016/11/11/13596792/facebook-fake-news-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump">downplayed concerns</a> about Facebook’s role in the 2016 presidential election (something he later said he regretted). His recent communications contain more<a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/2/16/14640460/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-manifesto-letter"> high-minded deliberation</a> than hard discussion of the company’s problems and how to deal with them.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="6448">These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="618" data-total-count="7066">Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company’s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook’s profitability. Indeed, there’s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg’s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="359" data-total-count="7425">In the near term, though, it’s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook’s extraordinary profitability – its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue – will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="7786" id="story-continues-6">If governments propose restrictions on using members’ data, Facebook’s business model would be tested. The company’s board, in theory, should press Mr. Zuckerberg for details on how he will deal with such shackles. But prominent board members like<a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/26/5837638/the-ipo-is-dying-marc-andreessen-explains-why"> Marc L. Andreessen</a> and<a href="http://bigthink.com/articles/peter-thiel-regulation-stifles-innovation"> Peter A. Thiel</a> are skeptical of regulation. Facebook might be tempted to fight back.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="8119">Lawmakers may hold the line, however, sensing that the public has real concerns about the company. And if Facebook’s responses look tardy and inadequate, the consequences could be harsh, as the fate of Wells Fargo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/business/wells-fargo-federal-reserve.html"> shows</a>.
