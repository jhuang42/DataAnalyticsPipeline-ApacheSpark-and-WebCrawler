Mr. Coogler’s film, based on an unsung 1960s creation of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, has inspired a level of anticipation that wildly exceeds the name recognition of its title character — owing, in part, to pent-up demand for a megabudget movie devoted to black life.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="176" data-total-count="1830" id="story-continues-2"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/media/mediator-wonder-woman-movie-hollywood.html">As with “Wonder Woman” last year</a>, another movie that spoke to an underserved population at a moment of acute political anxiety, audiences have reacted with partisan fervor.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="562" data-total-count="2392">“Black Panther” is already a phenomenon on social media, where eager fans are <a href="https://twitter.com/AleroJasmine/status/958893401226792960">teasing their</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Ashley_Escobar/status/959343794108977152">opening-night outfits</a>, ruminating on race and representation with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/lesserknownhero/status/960894563396222976">#WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe</a> and showing their support for the #BlackPantherChallenge (a spontaneous campaign to <a href="https://twitter.com/common/status/959608910905618432">buy tickets and popcorn for children</a>).

We’ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian — we can read subtitles for African languages now.

And that is so thrilling to me.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="4264"><strong>MICHAEL B. JORDAN</strong> It couldn’t have been done on a bigger level. If Marvel is behind it, then it’s gotta be O.K. Moving forward, everybody’s going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didn’t think were lucrative, didn’t think that anybody wanted to see.

It’s who’s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of “Black Panther”], it’s a place that’s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that’s what works, that’s what’s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that’s what leads to success.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="156" data-total-count="5135"><strong>Kevin, there’s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don’t perform well internationally.

One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe. And I think he’s delivered a movie that’s going to do that, and that disproves [beliefs] that had maybe never been true but had never been tested.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="117" data-total-count="5630" id="story-continues-4"><strong>For the actors, what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies you’ve done?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="5820"><strong>BOSEMAN</strong> I’ve done other films that have had historic significance because of what has happened in the past, but this not only refers to the past, it sets the stage for where we’re going.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="640" data-total-count="6460"><strong>GURIRA</strong> I’ve had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/theater/african-plays-danai-guirira-jocelyn-bioh.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">a passion for telling African stories</a> for a really long time, being American-born and Zimbabwe-raised. That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/theater/review-in-eclipsed-a-captive-lupita-nyongo-is-captivating.html"> 2016 drama “Eclipsed”</a> was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie. I had a childlike glee after my meeting with Ryan — I kind of floated around, found my car somehow. You think you’re alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think, “Oh wow, we’re all in it together? And y’all are doing this already? And I just have to be in it?” It was just so beautiful.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="429" data-total-count="6889"><strong>LUPITA NYONG’O</strong> Seeing it yesterday, I’m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We’re talking about some really deep issues that we don’t often voice but we all feel. [Ms. Nyong’o was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents and raised in Kenya.]</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="7260"><strong>BOSEMAN </strong>A lot of times, being [a black man] in Hollywood, when you get material you’ll read it and you’ll be like, “That’s not us.” When I got the initial call from Kevin Feige, my hope was that they would have the courage to give Black Panther its true essence and put somebody behind it that would have my same passion for what it could be. And they did that.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="7370"><strong>On set, did you have that feeling of “This is important” or did you just try to do good work like normal? </strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="7544"><strong>COOGLER</strong> I learned a skill from playing football.

I wouldn’t be no good to anybody.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="430" data-total-count="8758"><strong>NYONG’O</strong> A moment when I really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. There were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming, and between takes, the drummers started riffing to [Snoop Dogg’s] “Drop It Like It’s Hot.” The whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as Ryan figured things out below.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="9020">In that moment, I was like, “This is big.” I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="9233"><strong>Michael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from Killmonger’s identity as an African-American, which contrasts against T’Challa’s African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="350" data-total-count="9583"><strong>JORDAN</strong> Ryan [and I] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality, his outlook, his rage, his agenda. We felt like we could show where Erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry, why he is so lost. He doesn’t know who he is, but he knows the answers are out there.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="9889"><strong>BOSEMAN</strong> For me, [Killmonger and T’Challa] are two sides of the same coin — African and African-American. As an African-American, if you’re disconnected from your ancestry and your past, you have this conflict that comes from that and so there is a healing experience that is possible because of that.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="466" data-total-count="10355"><strong>COOGLER</strong> The fracture that Killmonger has, that’s the fracture I lived with my whole life. I’m from a place that I’d never been to and that nobody who I loved had been to because they couldn’t afford to go [to Africa. Mr. Coogler grew up in Richmond in Northern California]. So I would hear stories from them about this place that they didn’t even know anything about, and those stories were a counterbalance to the awful things that we did hear about them.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="401" data-total-count="10756"><strong>In the movie, Wakanda disguises vast technological resources from the world, and white people who aren’t in the know refer to it dismissively as a primitive backwater. That’s a very real view that a lot of people hold about Africa, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/trump-shithole-countries.html">recent comments attributed to the president</a> made clear.
