Another day an anonymous donor set up an $86 million Bitcoin-fortune charity called the Pineapple Fund. A Tesla was spotted with a BLOCKHN license plate. There’s a surge in people <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/more-people-are-looking-to-buy-bitcoin-with-their-credit-cards">looking to buy Bitcoin on their credit cards</a>. After the Long Island Iced Tea company announced it would pivot to blockchain, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/technology/bitcoin-blockchain-stock-market.html">its stock rose 500 percent in a day</a>.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="468" data-total-count="921">In 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it’s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="453" data-total-count="1374">The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends — developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks — who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="1676">The goal may be decentralization, but the money is extremely concentrated. Coinbase has more than <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/27/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-has-more-users-than-stock-brokerage-schwab.html">13 million accounts</a> that own cryptocurrencies.

He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="70" data-total-count="2225">“One like,” he said, pointing to his phone. “It got one like.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="2509" id="story-continues-6">Whether it’s all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There’s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="2686">Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of rosé while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn’t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="2832">“I do I.C.O.s. It’s my thing,” he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. “It’s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="482" data-total-count="3314">An initial coin offering is a way to raise money: A company creates its own cryptocurrency and investors buy into the new coin, without actually buying a stake in the company. Mr. Gardner led an I.C.O. for his start-up Augur, creating an “Augur token” that he then sold to raise real world money. These tokens sold fast, and it is one of the forces that kicked off this boom. For a time, the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/augur/">value of Augur</a>, a market-forecasting start-up with few customers, exceeded $1 billion.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="631" data-total-count="3945">About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and some of Mr. Gardner’s tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. He recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party. “You can I.C.O. anything,” he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising $75 million for his hedge fund, <a href="https://www.ausum.vc/">Ausum Ventures </a>(pronounced “awesome”). He said his closest friends are moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying taxes.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="134" data-total-count="4079">“They’re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,” he said. “But for me, it’s too early in my career to check out.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="4298" id="story-continues-7">He wears a bracelet from his Burning Man camp (<a href="http://mayanwarrior.mx/">Mayan Warrior</a>) and a necklace that is a key on a chain. “I was given this necklace and was told my net worth would go up, and it’s gone up six x since then,” he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="4467">He drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="4763">A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he’d ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: “Probably not,” he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he’s skeptical that it can add to his life.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="82" data-total-count="4845">“I literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,” he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="5069">A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="5246">“Nothing feels real, it doesn’t feel real,” he said. “I’m ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I’ll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="58" data-total-count="5331" id="story-continues-9">Nearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="5627">Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="5814">“My neurons are fried from all the volatility,” Mr. Hummer said. “I don’t even care at this point. I’m numb to it. I’ll lose a million dollars in a day and I’m like, O.K.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="6235">His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, ‘The Lizard of Wall Street,’ with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, “memento mori,” to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="6390" id="story-continues-10">“The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,” Mr. Hummer said. "It’s almost like the ultimate short trade.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="6717">Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="462" data-total-count="7179">He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn’t give specifics other than to say he’d quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There’s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they’ll be targeted and robbed since there’s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don’t know how much they’ve made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="91" data-total-count="7270">“It’s unforgiving,” Mr. Buttram said. “You make one mistake and it’s all gone.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="7648">They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency’s founder <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6tamgo/what_is_the_origin_of_the_vitalik_jesus_lambo/">frequently appears in fan art as Jesus with a Lambo</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6tamgo/what_is_the_origin_of_the_vitalik_jesus_lambo/">rghini</a>. Mr. Buttram says he’s renting an orange Lambo for the weekend. And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin “B” necklace encrusted with diamonds that he had made. Otherwise, HODL.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="8023">This is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, “hold” typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don’t really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="8198">“HODL when everyone has FUD,” Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. “This will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="8223">He knows this is strange.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="8356">“When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,” Mr. Hummer said. “It’s just a different level of consciousness.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="8378">The tone turns somber.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="122" data-total-count="8500">“Sometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,” Mr. Buttram said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="8568">Mr. Hummer said, “A bomb would set back civilization for years.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="8643">A few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder’s apartment.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="8978" id="story-continues-12">James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for “going full YOLO” and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="9121" id="story-continues-13">“I’m taking over her education,” Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="9198">Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="9502">“It’s the entire world reorganizing itself,” Mr. Fickel said. “We could get rid of our armies because for the first time you’ll have people saying, ‘I want to vote for a global order.’ It’s the internet waking up — it’s the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That’s the blockchain.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="9526">Mr. Hummer is skeptical.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="9600">“All I know is the price of ether is going to go up,” Mr. Hummer said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="9796">At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel’s personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="115" data-total-count="9911">“I’m retired, man,” Mr. Chen said. “I’m moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="136" data-total-count="10047">“Don’t say I’m retired,” he added. “I’m going into business now.

The waiting list had to be told not to show up. Many there wore Bitcoin- and Ethereum-themed clothes from <a href="https://hodlmoon.com/">Hodlmoon</a>, which sells unisex cryptocurrency sweaters.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="10846" id="story-continues-16">Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He’s part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="11107">“The technology still needs time to evolve,” Mr. Wuille said. "This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can’t fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="119" data-total-count="11226">He said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. “I tell them I have no idea,” he said. “I don’t know!”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="11570">“There’s so many people rushing into the space, if it’s a bit of speculation, I’m O.K. with that,” said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. “But we can’t guarantee the website’s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="129" data-total-count="11699">As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy — Arya Bahmanyar, 28 — was getting ready to perform.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="12028">Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (“you think I would dress up like this if I wasn’t?”). “Right now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture — not inside crypto, and we’ve got to change that,” he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="172" data-total-count="12200">He pointed to his outfit — a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes — and said, “It’s gold, right? It’s gold. It’s a niche, and I’m going to fill it.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="12398">He says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called “Lambo Party” and another called “Cryptomom,” about “all these moms are pumping in their children’s savings accounts.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="12634" id="story-continues-17">Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="272" data-total-count="12906" id="story-continues-19">She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, “Cinemark, the best seats in town.” She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn’t support her.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="13067">“Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,” she said.

She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="13522">“And maybe I’m going to lose it,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep cleaning houses.
