But these days, she is also wearing other hats, including running a makeup line called Flower and a namesake wine label with Carmel Road. And now she is again trying something new, playing a zombie in the Netflix dark comedy “Santa Clarita Diet,” out on Friday. When she isn’t dining on human flesh onscreen, she is probably seeking out the latest beauty find in real life. From her annual “barnacle removal” to her hair color O.C.D., Ms. Barrymore dishes all.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="942">I’m a compulsive face washer. For me, it’s three times a day, morning, noon and night. I like my cleansers baby mild. If I’m on the run, I grab a <a href="http://www.cetaphil.com/">Cetaphil</a>. Or I use one by <a href="http://christinechin.com/products.html">Christine Chin</a>. Then I have to have a toner, no matter what. Otherwise, I just break out. I have the <a href="http://www.clinique.com/acne-skin-care-clinique">Clinique acne clearing gel</a>, or again, I use Christine Chin. I would use Sea Breeze. It doesn’t matter. I just have to tone.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="1274">As you get older, you get melasma; you have kids; there’s sun damage. I like to pad my moisturizer with a Christine Chin brightening serum. I’m obsessed with her line. It’s the only thing I splurge on. I don’t have time to go for facials, so I haven’t seen her in years, but every couple of months, I’m buying the goods.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="1330">I like <a href="https://www.katesomerville.com/skin-care/eye-cream">Kate Somerville under-eye cream</a> for dark circles.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="415" data-total-count="1745">Then I definitely moisturize. The biggest game changer is, no question, Korean beauty. You get all this amazing moisturizing without the oil. I’ve used really expensive products and really inexpensive products, and most moisturizers break me out. The Korean masks have changed my life. The one I love the most is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JAYJUN-Lightenig-Hologram-Verified-Cosmetic/dp/B01E9Y2XVG">JayJun Baby Pure Shining Mask</a>. When I take it off, I look like I got out of a facialist appointment.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="1980" id="story-continues-2">Every SPF breaks me out. There are only two I’ve ever found that don’t: the new La Roche-Posay — it’s called <a href="http://www.laroche-posay.us/anthelios-clear-skin-3606000430488.html">Clear Skin Dry Touch</a> — and an SPF with powder by <a href="https://www.colorescience.com/?gclid=CIasuarGztECFYxLDQodqbAAqg">Colorescience</a>. Sometimes I do the Dry Touch with the powder on top.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="2297">I would say 90 percent of my life, I wear zero makeup. But I almost never leave the house without my Skincognito Stick Foundation from <a href="http://flowerbeauty.com/?gclid=CNGH4sDaztECFZGCswodZmoFBw">Flower</a>, because it covers blue, red, brown, purple. And I can’t live without <a href="https://www.aquaphorus.com/?gclid=CObl7pLHztECFQ6paQod4g4BPA">Aquaphor</a> for my lips. I’m convinced it’s got me on a feeder. I just need more, more and more.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="2600">I usually pick a lip color and stick with it for the month. Right now, I’m obsessed with Flower’s Sand Bar; it’s a matte color that comes in a squeeze-y tube. I do my lips and cheeks, and then whatever I have on my fingers, I just dot on my eyelids. It gives the eyes a sunset feel, a pinkish hue.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="410" data-total-count="3010" id="story-continues-3">Or I might use one of the Flower eye shadow palettes. I really like aubergine, because it makes my eyes greener. I also like to drag whatever is on the lid onto the bottom line so it feels like there’s a circular cohesion. I constantly mess up my brows. I’m not a good pencil drawer — I always overdo it. I look like Spock. So I use our Brow Master, which comes with a mascara wand. It’s user-friendly.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="3220">I’m usually too lazy for mascara. But our Zoom-In mascara is one of my favorites because it’s really goopy gloppy. I call them carpet lashes, as in actual real fringy carpet. The name never really took off.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="399" data-total-count="3623">I work with <a href="http://traceycunningham.com/">Tracey Cunningham</a> on my color, and have for 20-something years. I have O.C.D. with my hair, and she puts up with me. I’m happiest with a light ombré. I like a dark base and then the perfect amount of highlights and lowlights. We call it children’s beach hair. It looks so beach-y, easy and effortless, but you’re literally going strand by strand. Tracey has the patience of a god.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="4001">My favorite mask is the <a href="http://www.jflazartigue.com/">J.</a> <a href="http://www.jflazartigue.com/">F. Lazartigue</a> shea butter one. I glop it in, braid my hair and go to sleep, wake up and at some point take a shower. It completely brings back elasticity to the follicle. I also like Kérastase. It’s a great amazing brand you can find everywhere. And I just bought the <a href="http://www.philipb.com/product_info.php?products_id=54">Philip B Oud Royal conditioner</a>. It looks like gold paint coming out of the tube.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="4127">For shampoo, I love <a href="http://www.livingproof.com/buy/restore-shampoo">Living Proof</a><a href="http://www.livingproof.com/buy/restore-shampoo"> Restore</a>. That’s the only one that works for me. The other formulas and me do not get along.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="4301">I’m a dirty hippie. I love patchouli; I just love it straight. Give me Venice Beach, 1982. I love cedar wood, too. I love woody accords — sandalwood, Nag Champa.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="645" data-total-count="4960">Once a year I go to <a href="http://www.laserskinsurgery.com/Dermatologists/Roy-G-Geronemus-MD">Dr. Roy Geronemus</a> for a barnacle removal. He treats my face like the bow of a boat. I do a Clear &amp; Brilliant laser every October. After the summer, I look, honestly, like I have dirt all over my face from the melasma. It was so bad after my kids. No matter how much sunscreen and how many hats, I have a lot of brown spots. He knows I’m not going to do anything beyond lasers, so he doesn’t even bother talking about it. He did suggest some fillers the last time I was there. I was like: “Not happening, Dr. G! Talk to me in 10 years.” I’m not putting anything in my face until it’s <em>so</em> bad I have nothing to lose.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="475" data-total-count="5451">I go to <a href="http://aktinmotion.com/">AKT</a>. My girl is Becky. We have a mantra, “Let’s do everything!” She basically just circuits me for an hour until I feel like I’m going to die. I’ve never been the world’s leading expert on fitness, but now that I’m a mom and in my 40s, exercise is helping me maintain sanity. After the two babies, and all those weight fluctuations, I got really depressed for a while and packed on the pounds. All of a sudden, I felt I just couldn’t carry the weight.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="5798">California is diet central. Everything is clean and natural. I struggle in Manhattan. Ever since <a href="https://postmates.com/">Postmates</a> was invented, I’ve really struggled. It’s like a drug. I wish I had a Breathalyzer equivalent, where if I weigh a certain amount, I can order Postmates, and if I don’t, then I can’t order. Postmates has definitely sabotaged my life.</p>]
