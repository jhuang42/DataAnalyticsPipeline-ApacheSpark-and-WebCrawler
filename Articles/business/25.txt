Their rigid abstinence from many kinds of technology has left parts of their lifestyle frozen since the 19th century: no cars, TVs or connections to electric utilities, for example.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="153" data-total-count="877">But computers and cellphones are making their way into some Amish communities, pushing them — sometimes willingly, often not — into the 21st century.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="1168" id="story-continues-2">New technology has created fresh opportunities for prosperity among the Amish, just as it has for people in the rest of the world. A contractor can call a customer from a job site. A store owner’s software can make quick work of payroll and inventory tasks. A bakery can take credit cards.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="1507" id="story-continues-4">But for people bound by a separation from much of the outside world, new tech devices have brought fears about the consequence of internet access. There are worries about pornography; about whether social networks will lead sons and daughters to date non-Amish friends; and about connecting to a world of seemingly limitless possibilities.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="200" data-total-count="1707" id="story-continues-6">“Amish life is about recognizing the value of agreed-upon limits,” said Erik Wesner, an author who runs a blog, <a href="http://amishamerica.com/">Amish America</a>, “and the spirit of the internet cuts against the idea of limits.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="1833">John, who works a computerized saw at <a href="https://www.amishgazebos.com/">Amish Country Gazebos</a> near Lancaster, Pa., likened it to the prohibition on automobiles.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="2092" id="story-continues-8">“Not using cars is a way of keeping us together,” he said. (Like most of the people interviewed for this article, he declined to give his surname, out of an Amish sense of humility; many refrained from having their faces photographed for the same reason.)</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="119" data-total-count="2211">“There’s always a concern about what would lead our young folk out of the church and into the world,” John added.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="2421">The internet also threatens another Amish bonding agent: For a society in which formal education ends after eighth grade, youngsters learn a trade or craft alongside a relative or other member of the community.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="2658">“If you can just look it up on the internet, you’re not thinking,” said Levi, another woodworker. “The more people rely on technology, the more we want to sit behind a desk.

We love our way of life, but a bit of change is good.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="3398" id="story-continues-13">The Amish community is growing at a rate that may surprise outsiders — and that growth is helping to push the sect’s adoption of technology.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="3740">The Amish population in the United States <a href="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/files/2017/08/Population_Change_1992-2017.pdf">is estimated at 313,000</a>, up nearly 150 percent from 25 years ago, according to researchers at Elizabethtown College near Lancaster. Large families are the chief reason: Married women have seven children on average, and Amish people marry at a higher rate and at a younger age than Americans over all.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="431" data-total-count="4171">In the Lancaster area, as open land has become scarce and more costly, the rapid population growth has pushed some Amish families into more rural areas in places like upstate New York. Others have left farming and moved into business trades. Moses Smucker, for example, opened a food store and sandwich shop at Philadelphia’s popular Reading Terminal Market. Six days a week, he is driven from the Lancaster area to Philadelphia.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="4339">“Philadelphia is very fast-paced,” he said. “Then I go home, and I can drive my horse.

It takes credit cards, and has four and a half stars on Yelp.

Kraybill, a retired professor at Elizabethtown’s Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="5113">This “very entrepreneurial, very capitalistic” tendency, he said, was all the more remarkable because it was channeled through a “culture of restraint.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="5254" id="story-continues-18">Many Amish people draw a bright line between what is allowed at work — smartphones, internet access — and what remains forbidden at home.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="5610">Still, the divisions can get fuzzy. Connecting a house to the public utility is unheard of, but many homes are electrified with power generators and solar panels. Propane-powered refrigerators are found in many kitchens. And “Amish taxi” services, driven by non-Amish people, provide a way to get around without violating the rule against owning a car.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="5841">John, the woodworker at Amish Country Gazebos, spends part of his time operating the computer-guided saw, which would look at home in any modern cabinetry shop. His mastery of the machine, at 68, can be a source of teasing at home.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="5952">“We call him the computer geek sometimes,” said his son, Junior, laughing as the family sat down to supper.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="6170" id="story-continues-20">The crowd around the table on this evening made for an Amish tableau.

The family members bowed their heads to say grace. No buzzing phone would interrupt this meal.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="6431">John had his worries about where technology was taking the Amish community.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="6711">“We’re not supposed to have computers; we’re not supposed to have cellphones,” he said. “We’re allowed to have a phone, but not in the house. But to do business, you need a computer, or access to one, and that phone moves into the house. So how do you balance that?”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="6790" id="story-continues-23">Lizzie said she was upset by how people had become so attached to their phones.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="7039">“People are treating those phones like they are gods,” she said. “They’re bowing down to it at the table, bowing down to it when they’re walking. Here we say we don’t bow down to idols, and that’s getting dangerously close, I think.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="7113">Professor Kraybill said such insights were not unusual among Amish people.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="108" data-total-count="7221">They “are more savvy about the impact of technology on human interactions than most of us are,” he said.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="416" data-total-count="7637" id="story-continues-25">Mr. Wesner said that Amish concerns about the effects of constant cellphone use may be borne out in the wider world. Things are said online that would never be said in public. The speed and accessibility of communicating online can lead people to be impatient and dissatisfied with a slower, more deliberate life. Regular use of cellphones can result in an over-reliance on machines and technology to solve problems.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="51" data-total-count="7688">And a phone can pull individuals away from a group.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="7879">“A cellphone and some earbuds are all it takes to place yourself in your own world, isolated from the rest of society,” Mr. Wesner said. “In some sense that is profoundly anti-Amish.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="7983">For now, some people in the Amish community seem to be able to keep modern technology at arm’s length.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="8148" id="story-continues-27">Sam, 29, who used to make deliveries for Amish Country Gazebos, now works on a computer in the company’s shop.

Now, he added, he is amazed at how productive the computer can be. “I can easily see it helping as far as numbers go — oh my goodness — to get rid of all these papers.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="203" data-total-count="8662">But technology has its place, he said, and that is at work. Speaking outside his home near Lancaster one sun-dappled day, he said, “I’ve never thought about bringing a computer onto this property.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="8871">Not far away, his wife was cutting the lawn with a push mower, the blades making a soft whirring sound as they scissored the grass.
