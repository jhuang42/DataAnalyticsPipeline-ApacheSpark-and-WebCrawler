The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="291" data-total-count="2286">The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&amp;P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="2509">Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day’s violent decline—the S.&amp;P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011—reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="2884">For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility—the ups and downs of stock prices—hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="382" data-total-count="3266" id="story-continues-4">But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data—such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday—showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="3283"><em>— Matt Phillips</em><br/></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="3567">The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="3866">Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="697" data-total-count="4563">Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period’s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers’ willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="4578"><em>— Peter Eavis</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="4703">The company reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/snap-earnings-q4-2017.html">earnings after the close</a> that easily beat analysts’ expectations.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="11" data-total-count="4714"><strong>The Numbers</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="118" data-total-count="4832">• Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="4909">• The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="114" data-total-count="5023">• Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="11" data-total-count="5034"><strong>The Context</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="5340">Snap’s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap’s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="84" data-total-count="5471" id="story-continues-5">The stock market’s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="5776">Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&amp;P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="62" data-total-count="5838">But there are reasons investors shouldn’t get too concerned.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="6082"><strong>1)</strong> Heading into the final hour of trading, the markets have rebounded strongly. The Dow has jumped 2 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent. That suggests that worst of the sell-off may be passed.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="6296"><strong>2)</strong> The outlook for economic growth is strong in the United States. The American economy grew 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker forecasts a 4 percent rise in the first quarter.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="363" data-total-count="6659"><strong>3) </strong>Corporate America’s bottom line is growing. With 50 percent of the companies in the S.&amp;P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&amp;P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="462" data-total-count="7121"><strong>4)</strong> The sell-off comes after a big run-up in stocks. Until Monday, the Dow and the S.&amp;P. 500 hadn’t endured a pullback of 5 percent in more than 400 sessions. Since 1929, a 5 percent decline happens every 92 days on average, according to Goldman Sachs. So stocks were arguably due for a selloff. But it should be noted that after Monday’s declines the Dow was at levels last seen in, well, mid-December and was up more than 30 percent since the 2016 election.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="40" data-total-count="7161">Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="7635">The company, founded by Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/science/falcon-heavy-spacex-launch.html">achieved a new milestone</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/science/falcon-heavy-spacex-elon-musk.html">a successful test launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket</a>, the most powerful rocket in operation in the world today.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="31" data-total-count="7666">Here’s a video of the launch:</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="7869">When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="8177">That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday.

Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="8731">Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending.

One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise.
