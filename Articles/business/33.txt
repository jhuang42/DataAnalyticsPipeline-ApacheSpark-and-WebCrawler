But by the time the show reached Broadway in 1991, Mr. Pryce had abandoned those practices, and, after he won a Tony Award and left the show, the producers changed their approach — in the years since, they have chosen only actors of Asian heritage to play the Engineer, both on Broadway and on the United States tours.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="408" data-total-count="1756" id="story-continues-3">Not every controversy has been calmed. The show’s critics, who tried and failed to stop the initial production and have periodically protested it since, say the production perpetuates an unwelcome view of Asians.

It was a young girl at the airport (in Vietnam), facing her mother. The mother had been looking for her ex-partner, a G.I., and she wanted to send the girl to the United States for a better future. The mother did exactly the same sacrifice as Cio-Cio-San in “Madama Butterfly,” who committed suicide to force the American, Pinkerton, to take their boy with him. So I called Alain, and said, “Imagine the story of ‘Butterfly,’ happening at the end of the Vietnam War.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="150" data-total-count="2607"><strong>Alain Boublil (lyricist)</strong> We got quickly to the idea that the misunderstanding between two people reflected the misunderstanding between two countries.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="2912"><strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/af6b04f6-ba34-11e5-bf7e-8a339b6f2164">Cameron Mackintosh</a> (producer) </strong>This was a very dangerous, but exciting, subject.

He and I were really fresh off of doing this reasonably successful play (“M. Butterfly”) in which the whole notion of “Madama Butterfly” is turned on its head. He was reporting, in a kind of amused way, about this show in the West End, with these two guys in yellowface (the Engineer and Thuy, Kim’s cousin). We said, surely the show will come to the United States, but the yellowface will never happen here, because that’s the kind of thing that only happens in England now.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="565" data-total-count="5584"><strong><a href="http://leasalonga.com/">Lea Salonga</a> </strong><strong>(actress who played Kim, the bargirl, in the original London and Broadway productions)</strong> I was in Manila, and in my freshman year at college — I was pre-med. I was 17, and I was very innocent. I didn’t know what a bargirl was. And my concerns were less about that than some of the skimpy costumes I had to wear — I grew up pretty conservative. I called my father, and said, “What am I going to do?” and he said, “They’re not going to remember that. They’re going to remember when you shoot yourself at the end.” And I guess he was right.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="605" data-total-count="6209"><strong>Wong</strong> Much to our surprise, there was an announcement that Jonathan Pryce was coming. So I wrote a letter to the actors’ union, which had to approve the visa, even for a star coming over. After decades of Caucasian actors impersonating Asian characters in television, movies and in the theater, with a certain amount of comfort from audiences at large, it finally became absolutely essential for the Asian-American audience community and the Asian-American acting community to say it’s too painful for us to watch this anymore — we can’t take it any more, it embarrasses us, and it’s humiliating.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="6482"><strong>Rich</strong> I’m completely sympathetic, and argue further that Asian-American actors have a particularly raw deal — there are so few opportunities for them compared to other minorities, let alone majorities.

This was 1990, and a lot of work had been done already. Our position was not to be inflammatory, but it was a cri de coeur in response to what their team had said, which was that there was no Asian-American actor qualified to play the role. That really stirred the pot.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="390" data-total-count="7394"><strong>Boublil</strong> It was a bit disturbing for us, because suddenly the subject of the show was not anymore the doomed love story and the mother’s ultimate sacrifice, which is what we had written. Suddenly the subject was casting controversy. I remember even some journalist in a magazine who said, “Don’t let this show come to this country. It’s going to destroy the fabric of the country.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="91" data-total-count="7513"><strong>Wong</strong> In this really dramatic, theatrical way, Equity voted to deny Jonathan Pryce his visa.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="7816"><strong>Mackintosh</strong> I was just astonished. And it got, as you know, quite sticky. At that point, even though we had the biggest advance in history, I said, look, if the show isn’t going to come here with the performances that made it so fantastic in London, I’d rather it didn’t move at all. I canceled it.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="403" data-total-count="8219" id="story-continues-5"><strong>Wong</strong> Equity had a real problem on its hands. The membership was divided. Some people thought it was absurd to make an issue of the race of a person. And the pressure came from other places. There was a lot of op-ed stuff. The mayor of New York (David Dinkins) really wanted the show to come in. A few days later, Equity rescinded its decision. It was profoundly sad.

So I saw it on Broadway, and it was glorious. And then it hits you — what did I just experience? And then it’s awful. But I had never seen a helicopter land on Broadway before, and I was mesmerized by the music and the stagecraft, and also the pride that I felt at seeing Lea nail that role on Broadway.

We knew that the Asian-American acting community had an incredibly good point, and it was the beginning of a huge shift in the way we think about casting.

It doesn’t negate what happened, but a lot of people wouldn’t have seen that error. In 1995, I had gone to New York for a wedding, and in Backstage I saw an open call for Chrises and Johns, so I went and stood in line and danced on the Broadway stage.

And after this, I did “The King and I”; I did “Pacific Overtures”; I did “Flower Drum Song”; and I did “Oliver.” “Miss Saigon” enabled me to save enough money to have a nest egg, start a family and find a home, and now I’m retired — another thing “Miss Saigon” enabled me to do is have a great pension.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="572" data-total-count="11418"><strong>Margaret Ann Gates (actress in multiple productions)</strong> I heard that they were looking for actual Asians to be in the show — not people who were face-painting, and I went into the ensemble a month or two after graduating from college. Then they offered me the role of Ellen (an American woman who marries a returning G.I.) in 1998. I was the first Asian to hold the role, and when I started, people were like, “That’s not right! Ellen’s supposed to be white!”, which of course is ridiculous — just because somebody is American doesn’t mean she has to be white. <strong><br/></strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="627" data-total-count="12045"><strong>Ethan Thoi (actor in Australian production)</strong> I couldn’t believe there was a musical about Vietnam, where I was born. I was born in 1973, and my mom had some involvement with a Western guy at that time — her pregnancy was not accepted, and she had to give me away. In 2007, when the show came to Sydney, I was lucky to be in the ensemble. I did the whole national tour (in Australia) — about 14 months — and every night I was crying at the part where she sings, “I’d give my life for you,” and crying at the part where the refugees are climbing up the walls, because I was also a refugee, from Vietnam to Australia.<strong><br/></strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="536" data-total-count="12604"><strong>Pun Bandhu (actor active with Asian American Performers Action Coalition) </strong>There continue to be protests against “Miss Saigon” across the country, and I think that’s because the Asian community is so tired of seeing ourselves portrayed in one way. In many ways, “Miss Saigon” is a colonial story, where none of the Asian characters are portrayed in a positive light — yes, they are victims of a war, but they are also characterized as opportunists, villainous, and, at the center of the story, Kim is written to be very weak.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="12851" id="story-continues-8"><strong>Oka</strong> It turned into a political protest about the portrayal of Asian women on the stage.

And you can rally and rail against Asian women as prostitutes, but you can’t erase history. This is set in 1975, not in 2017, and this really happened. I’m from Manila, and it still happens. Go to any red-light district, and that’s what you see: a girl with desperation in her eyes, wanting to not be doing this, and another girl who is dead on the inside. I don’t know of too many shows that allow the audience to see that reality. It’s very eye-opening, and can be quite jarring.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="574" data-total-count="14134"><strong>Will Chase (actor who played Chris, the G.I., in multiple productions) </strong>I used to make fun of it when I was a longhaired percussionist at Oberlin College. Then I did three years in the show. And over the course of doing it, we would have Vietnam vets come talk to the cast. I started to pay attention to it in a different way. One guy said when he got back home he would wake up in the middle of the night with a gun, ready to blow his brains out, night after night, and the show was cathartic for him. He came once a week. Those kinds of stories made me grow up in the show.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="278" data-total-count="14438"><strong>Ralph </strong><strong>B. Peña</strong> One of the songs — the marriage song, I found out later — was gobbledegook, not even real Vietnamese.

I didn’t know what happened until I read the script when I was cast. I was like, “Oh my goodness, this is epic.” I’m a prostitute in this, and it’s not glamorous, it’s not pretty. It is demeaning. But this happened to real people. And the refugee scene — that’s relevant today.

I first encountered “Miss Saigon” in 1988, when they came back to Manila to cast the male ensemble, and I auditioned. I was 22, and left the Philippines for the first time. And now, for me to be playing the Engineer on the biggest stage of all, it’s an honor and it’s a responsibility. I truly believe that, because of “Miss Saigon,” Asian actors are seen in a different light.</p>]
