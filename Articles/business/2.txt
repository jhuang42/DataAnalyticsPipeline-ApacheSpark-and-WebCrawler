And with good reason. Amazon could spend huge sums, and bear years of losses, to win customers with lower prices.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="964" id="story-continues-1">But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="14" data-total-count="978"><strong>1) What is it?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="1325">The venture will be an independent company that “is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.” That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won’t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="29" data-total-count="1354" id="story-continues-3"><strong>2) How big will it really be?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1024" data-total-count="2378">The effort focuses on the United States employees of JPMorgan Chase, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway. Together, the companies have nearly one million employees (a portion of those, though, are outside of the United States.) That’s a lot of employees but relatively small when compared with 157 million people who had employer health care plans at the end of 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Would the venture be able to scale up? Some experts are skeptical about that.<a href="http://alliancestrategy.com/amazon-morgan-berkshire-partnership-balloon/"> Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor of international business at Brandeis, wrote</a>: “My bet is that JPMorgan and Amazon’s employees have pretty good health coverage, with plans that rank among the richest that the industry has to offer. If so, will these lead users be anxious to find a more cost-effective model? Will they even be willing to experiment with their coverage? And, beyond that – if they do develop a new approach, will it be helpful to the masses of employees at lesser companies, or, worse, the unemployed and uninsured?”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="2466"><strong>3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="594" data-total-count="3060">It’s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don’t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire’s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="94" data-total-count="3154"><strong>4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?</strong></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="475" data-total-count="3629">Much depends on whether the effort can address the main reason that health care spending has gone up in the United States versus other countries. A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/upshot/us-health-care-expensive-country-comparison.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">Upshot column</a> showed how much of the rise is a result of more being done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, or that they are charged more for those services. One way to assess the brash new initiative from Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon is whether it does anything to address this dynamic.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="3644"><em>— Peter Eavis</em></p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="3793">That’s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation’s “ballooning costs of health care” Tuesday.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="3975">Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/technology/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-health-care.html">announced it is teaming up with JPMorgan Chase and</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/technology/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-health-care.html"> Amazon</a> to form an independent health care company to serve their employees in the United States.</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="4359">The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort “free from profit-making incentives and constraints.”</p>,class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="4733">Mr. Buffett’s concern about rising health care costs is not new, nor is his use of “tapeworm” to describe them.
